2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,070
Here we have to list. Let's say we
 want to combine these two lists into

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,730
a single list of topples like this. So

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,640
we have a list where
 each item is a topple and

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,110
in the first couple. we're going
 to have the first element of each

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,210
list. So one and 10 Similarly. in the

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,530
second Topple. we're going to have
 the second element of each list. And

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,740
finally. the third Topple. How can we

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,780
combine these two lists into
 a single list like this. Well

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,720
. in this case. we can use
 the map function or a list comprehension

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,370
because both these work
 with a single list. But

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,860
here we're combining multiple lists. To achieve this

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,450
. we use the
 built in zip function. So

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,920
zip. Look. this function takes multiple deliverables

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,530
and it will combine them the
 way I showed you. So we

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,250
pass list one and list too. Let's

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,290
print the result on the terminal. So

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,160
look, it returns a zip object
 which is also iterable.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,530
So we can iterate over
 it or simply pass it to

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,890
the built in list function to convert it

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,170
to a list. Now. let me
 show you something cool as you

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,030
saw this zip function
 takes one or more honorables

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,640
so we don't have to pass a list here.
 I can also pass a

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,420
string like ABC and look

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,440
at the result. So now our strength ABC

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,910
is spread across multiple topples in

27
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,220
this list. That's pretty powerful.
If you want to actually have the same thing

28
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,550
in other programming languages you have to write several lines of code,
but in Python we can do it in a single line.
