00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,250
mhm. If you

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,030
have any experience with other programming languages.
 you've probably heard

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,920
of the term Lambda
 Expression or Lambda function. It's

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,210
basically a simple one line, anonymous function that

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,980
we can pass to other functions.
 So here. online 12

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,440
. we're passing a reference
 to our sort underlying item

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,030
function. We can improve this
 code and make it cleaner

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,000
by using a lambda
 expression or an anonymous function

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,320
. So we don't have to define
 this function first and then pass it

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,850
here. So we remove this and

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,750
add Lambda. With this we're telling Python that

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,510
we're defining a lambda or anonymous function. The

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,470
syntax for writing a lambda function is like this: 
 We add parameters

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,530
colon expression. So using this syntax we

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,660
can rewrite this function.
 How many parameters do we

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,550
have here? Only one.
 So we add that here, item.

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,970
Then after the colon.
 we should add an expression. What

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,610
are we returning in our sort
 Underline item function? We

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,860
are returning item of one.
 So we simply add that

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,040
here. item on one. Now we

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,620
can see with this syntax we
 don't need to use def for defining

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,220
a function. 
We don't need to give our function a name,
We

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,250
don't need these parenthesis here,
 and we don't need the return statement. So

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,630
this is a shorter and
 cleaner way to define a

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,520
function that we're going to use
 only once as an argument to

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,510
another function. Now, Let's delete these

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,040
two lines.
Run our program again. We'll

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,800
get the exact same result.
 Our items are sorted by the price.
