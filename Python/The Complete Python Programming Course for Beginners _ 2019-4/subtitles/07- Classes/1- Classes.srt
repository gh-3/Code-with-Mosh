2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,100
In this section we're going to look
 at classes which are extremely important in

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,090
python programming or in programming in general. So

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,400
let's start with an example.
 I'm going to define a list

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,590
of numbers like this. Now you have

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,160
learned that when we use the dark notation.
 we get access to

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,040
all these functions or. more accurately. methods enlist

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,950
objects. so every list
 object in python has these

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,180
methods now. Wouldn't it
 be nice if we could

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,700
create an object like shopping cart. And this

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,210
object would have methods like add. remove. get

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,830
total like this. Or as another

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,990
example. Wouldn't that be nice if
 we could have a point. Object with

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,480
methods like Draw. move or get

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,410
distance to get the
 distance between this point and

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,770
another point. That's when classes come to

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,360
the rescue. So a
 class is a blueprint for

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,640
creating new objects. Throughout the course. you have

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,850
heard the term class.
 for example. Let's define a

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,150
variable and set it to an integer.
 and then print it's

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,560
type. When we run this program.
 what do you see here

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,110
. A class of aunt.
 So in Python we have

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,190
a class called Aunt for creating managers. Similarly

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,920
. we have classes
 for creating billions. lists. dictionaries

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,740
and so on. 
So every object that we have in python is created

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,880
using a class which is
 a blueprint for creating objects of

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,710
that type. In this section.
 you're going to learn how to create custom

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,310
classes like customer shopping. cart point

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,810
and so on. Now.
 before we get started. let's define

30
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,360
a few terms. Once again. a class is

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,310
a blueprint for creating new objects. An

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,770
object is an instance of a class. As

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,540
an example. we could have
 a class called Human. and

34
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,610
this class would define all
 the attributes of humans. Then

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,650
we could create objects like John. Mary

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,500
. Jack and so on.
 So this is a difference between classes and

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,810
objects. Now a lot of
 people use these terms interchangeably

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,460
. but technically a class
 and an object are different. So

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,140
now you know what classes are
 and how they're useful. In the next

40
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,650
lecture. I'm going to show you how
 to create a custom class in Python
