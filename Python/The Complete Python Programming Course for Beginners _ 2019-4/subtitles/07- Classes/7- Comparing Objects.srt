00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,750
There are times that we need to compare two objects. 
For example here

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,460
we have this point object.
If I define another point object

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,510
with the exact same values 
then compare

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,870
them and print the

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,970
result, What do you think we're going to get? 
Let's take a

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,660
look. 
We get False.
What's going on here? 
The

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,840
reason we get False is that 
by default this equality operator

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,400
compares the references or addresses of these two

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,250
objects in memory. 
In this case these two variables are

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,870
referencing to different objects in memory and 
that's why they're

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,980
not equal. 
To solve this problem we need a

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,930
magic method. 
That magic method is called when we compare two

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,700
objects. So back to this page here

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,130
we have comparison magic methods. Let's

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,400
take a look. So these are
 all the magic methods we have for

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,080
comparing two objects.
 for example. we have EQ for

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,220
testing equality. We also have any which is

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,650
short for not equal. We have L t.
 which is short for less

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,330
than greater than and so on. So back

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,580
to a point class.
 we need to define e

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,010
que magic method.
 On that page. we can see

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,810
that this method requires two parameters self and

24
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,350
other. Now. in this method.
 we need to return

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,060
true if these two
 objects are equal. otherwise false

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,160
. So we can write
 an expression like this self that

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,310
X equals other than eggs and self

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,170
that wine equals other than why. So

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,570
if this expression is evaluated to true. these

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,780
two objects are considered equal. Now let's

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,250
save the changes. We run our program
 one more time. and we get true

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,430
Beautiful. Now what if
 you want to compare these

33
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,680
two point objects like this if point is

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
greater than other. we run the program. We

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,010
get a type error because the
 greater than operator is not supported

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,410
based on instances of
 the point class. So to

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,410
solve this problem. we need to define another

38
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,760
magic method. So define G t

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,970
. which is short for greater
 than once again. We have two

40
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,280
parameters self and other and write some code

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,750
like this. Return Self dot X is greater

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,350
than other that X and self that y

43
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,510
is greater than other. that why save the

44
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,060
changes. Now. Let's modify this

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,540
value So I'm going to
 change the X and y

46
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,440
of the first point
 to 10 and 20 So

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,850
the first point is greater
 than the second point. Let's run

48
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,590
the program. We get true beautiful.
 What if we

49
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,810
change this to less
 than run the program. We

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,900
get false. So as you see
 you don't have to explicitly implement

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,380
each of these operators, 
when you implement the greater than

52
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,590
magic method Python would
 automatically figure out 
 what to do if you use less than operator.
