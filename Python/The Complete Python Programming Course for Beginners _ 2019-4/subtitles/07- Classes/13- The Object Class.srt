2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,740
So in the last lecture
we defined this Mammal object. 
Now

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,160
let me show you a couple
of useful built in functions. 
We

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,400
have this function is instance and it

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,730
tells us if an object
 is an instance of a given

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,140
class. So if you pass em and

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,770
mammal here. obviously this M object is an instance

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,400
of mammal. So when
 we print the result. we

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,220
should see True. What if you pass animal

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,540
here. Let's run the program. We still get

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,610
true because mammal inherits from animal So an

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,140
instance of the mammal class is also an

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,450
animal. 
Now let me show you something interesting. 
This

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,350
animal class that were defined
 here inherits from another class

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,750
called object, even though
 we didn't add that here.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,470
So we have a class called
 object and that is the base class

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,610
for all classes in python.
 So every class that we have directly

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,080
or indirectly derives from the object class. 
Let

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,330
me show you. 
So that's still at this and go

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,410
back to line 18. 
Let's see if I

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,220
am is an instance of object. 
Run

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,770
the program. 
We get true. 
So mammal inherits from

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,100
animal which inherits from object. 
We also have this

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,920
built in function for creating an empty object. 
Now

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,680
if we inspect this object you

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,110
can see all these magic methods.
 These are the magic methods that

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,940
every class in python has.
 So if we type m

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,290
dot you can see our mammal
 class or are mammal. Object also

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,570
has these methods because
 it inherited them from the

30
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,090
base object class. We have
 another built in function that

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,460
you might find useful
 in certain situations and that

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,900
is is subclass. And with

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,660
this we can see if
 a class derives from another class

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,820
. So let's see if
 mammal is a subclass of

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,200
animal print. The result. obviously

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,500
we get true now.
 If we change animal to object, we

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:23,000
still get true because 
mammal indirectly derives or inherits 
from the object class.
