2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,870
In this example our Animal class
 has this constructor where we

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,140
initialize the age attribute to one. 
What If

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,860
you want to add a constructor
 to the Mammal class and initialize its

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,210
weight? 
Let's do that and see what happens? 
So to

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,950
save time I'm going to
 copy these two lines and

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,900
then paste them into mammal class. Now

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,070
. instead of the age attribute.
 I'm going to set the weight attribute

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,360
to To with this. Let's

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,590
print em that age as well as

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,120
M that weight run the program began

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,980
. Attribute error because
 mammal object has no attribute

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,070
. H. The reason this
 happened was because this constructor

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,820
in the animal class was not executed. 
In other

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,100
words this constructor that we
 define in the Mammal class replaced

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,290
the constructor in the base class.
 This is what we call method

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,080
overriding. So we are overriding or replacing a

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,300
method in the base class.
 Now what if we still want

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,660
to execute this constructor and initialize the age

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,260
of an animal? 
That's very easy. 
Here in the constructor of

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,010
the mammal class we can
 use the built in super function

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,580
to get access to the super
 or base class which is in this

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,260
case animal. 
So you have an access to the animal class

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,970
dot, 
now we can call any of the methods in this

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,590
class. So let's go
 ahead and call the innit

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,990
method Now to see the execution flow. I'm

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,280
going to add a print
 statement here and print mammal

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,250
constructor. Similarly. here

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,560
in the constructor of the animal.
 I'm going to print animal constructor

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,990
. Let's save the changes and run
 the program to see what happens. As

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,350
you can see first. the constructor
 of the animal was called. So

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,000
here we set the age to one.
 Then the constructor

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,280
of the mammal was called
 where we said the way to

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,580
to and finally we print one and two

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,230
. which are the results
 of these two statements. Now

36
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,530
we can also change the order
 of this method calls so we

37
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,460
can call the constructor of
 the animal after we initialize

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,780
a mammal object. So here in

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,470
the mammal class. instead of calling Super that

40
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,770
in its first. we're going
 to do it. After we do

41
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,210
all the basic work in
 the mammal constructor. let's save

42
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,480
the changes and run the program.
 As you can see. the

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,750
constructor of mammal was called
 first and then we have the

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,590
constructor of the animal. 
So to recap

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,520
method overriding means 
replacing or extending

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,370
a method defined in the base class.
 In this implementation

47
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,500
. we're extending the innit method
 that we have defined in the

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,160
animal class. Because here
 we do some work in

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,830
the constructor of the mammal and
 then we call the constructor of

50
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,370
the animal. 
If we didn't have this line here, 
this

51
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,000
implementation would completely replace 
the init method in the animal class.
