2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,290
There are times that we need to
work with external resources like files,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,800
network connections,
databases and so on. 
Whenever we

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,160
use these resources after we're done
 we need to release them.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,710
For example when you open a file
 we should always close it

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,300
after we're done, otherwise 
another process or another program 

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,640
may not be able to open that file. 
So let's take

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,940
this example to the next level.
Here in our try block, first

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm going to open a file.
 so we call the open function

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,000
and let's open up app.py. 
Here this

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
returns a file object.
So let's get that here. 
Now

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,300
When we're done we should close this file object. 
So this

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,150
file object has a method called close.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,350
Now the problem with this code
 is that this statement will not be

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,880
executed in case of an exception.
 In other words

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,140
if one of these two lines, line 3 or line

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,330
4, throws an exception the control will

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,930
be moved to our except clause, so 
what we have on line 5

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,250
will not be executed.
 One solution is to move this

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,680
down here. but again. the problem
 is that this will only be

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,770
executed if we have an exception.
 If we don't have an

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,360
exception. the control will be
 moved here so our file will

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,010
not be closed. So another
 solution is to duplicate this

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,670
year. And duplication is a
 bad practice in programming. You

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,550
should not repeat yourself in your code.
 So what is the solution. The

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,370
solution is to use the final clause.
 Let me show you. So

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm going to delete this line here and

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,960
at a final clause at the end. 
This finally

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,400
clause is always executed whether
 we have an exception or

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,370
not and we use it
to release external resources. 
So

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:57,000
this is the perfect place
 to close files, database connections, 
 network connections and so on.
