2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,200
In the last lecture, you learned that 
we use the finally clause 
to release external

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,570
resources. 
Now we have a shorter and cleaner way to achieve

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,190
the same thing but 
without the finally clause.
But it doesn't always

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,420
work. 
It works with certain kinds of objects. 
Let me

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,610
explain. 
So online 2 I'm going

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,880
to make a couple of slight changes.
Instead of getting the

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,790
return value of the open function, 
we prefix this 

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,570
with the with statement. 
And then we'll get access to 

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,360
the return value of this function by 
typing as file.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
So this is the file object that 
the open function returns. 
After 

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,450
that we add a colon, so obviously here
 we're going to have a block.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,370
In this block of code we can
work with this file object. 
For example

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,000
we can read something from this file or 
write to it and so on. 
So

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,260
for now let's just print file opened. 
Now,

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,530
Whenever we open a
file using the with statement, Python

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,550
will automatically call file dot close whether

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,410
we have a final clause or not.
In other words the

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,160
with statement is used to automatically release external

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,540
resources. 
So now we can delete these

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,740
two lines from here. 
that's better. 
But let's

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,050
dive deeper and see how
this exactly works under the

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,990
hood? 
So look at this file object file

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920
dot. 
These are the members of the file object. 
We

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,440
have methods that start with two underlines and 

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,910
we referred to them as magic methods.
 In the next section, where

27
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,210
I talk about classes and objects,
 you're going to learn about this in

28
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,410
detail. 
But here we have two magic methods that 
you should be

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,660
aware of. 
We have __enter__ and __exit__.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,280
when an object has these two methods, 
we say that object supports 

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,990
context management protocol. 
Again in the next section I'm

32
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,480
going to talk about this in more detail.
So if an object supports

33
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,770
the context management protocol or 
in other words if an

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,550
object has these two methods enter and exit,

35
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,070
we can use that object with the with statement. 
Python 

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,460
will automatically call the exit method
 and there, it

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,910
will release external resources.
 That is the reason we don't need

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,700
a finally clause here. 
Now to take this to the next level there

39
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,650
are times that you might
 be working with multiple external resources. 

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,820
Let's say we want to read some data from one file and 
write it to another

41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,180
file. 
So How do we do that?
Well here before

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,170
the colon we can add
 a comma and open another

43
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,720
external resource like another file. 
So open. 
Let's

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,380
say another file dot txt
as we

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,820
give it a variable name like target. 
with this

46
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,650
Python will automatically release both these external resources.

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,310
Now I'm going to delete the second one
 here because we don't have a file called another

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,880
dot txt, so when we run this program 
we'll get an exception and

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,000
our program will crash. 
So delete. 
So this is all about with statement.
