00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,900
In this lecture. I'm going to show you how
 to add new items to a list or

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,080
remove existing items. So for adding items. you

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,520
have two options depending on
 where you want to add this

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,970
new item. If you want to add
 an item at the end of the list,

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,700
you should use
 the append method. so earlier

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,990
You learn that everything in
 python is an object. so you

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,850
can use the dot notation
 to access individual functions or

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,190
more accurately
 methods in that object. So when

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,400
a function is part of an object
 we refer to that function as a

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,090
method. So here are
 all the methods available on

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,020
list objects. We use the
 append method to add something

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,480
at the end of this list.
 Let's print our

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,950
letters and we will
 get a B C D.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,200
Beautiful. Now, if you want
 to add an item at a

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,260
specific position, you should
 use the insert method. So

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,510
letters dot insert we can add something at

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,880
the beginning of the list.
 So Index zero. Let's

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,180
add hyphen and then print the

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,580
results. So this is what we get. Now,

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,590
for removing objects again.
 You have a few different options. If

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,960
you want to remove item at the
 end of the list, you should use

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,730
the pop method.
 So here we call letters dot

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,120
pop. This will remove the
 letter d at the end

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,620
of our list. So now let's print our

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,160
letters. As you can see d is gone.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,820
You can also pass an index
 here to remove the item at the

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,070
given index. So if you pass zero, instead

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,740
of d, this hyphen will be removed.
 Let's take a look. We

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,120
run this so the hyphen
 is gone and we get a

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,470
VCD. Beautiful. Now there are
 times that you want to remove

32
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,610
an object but you don't
 know it's index. If that's the

33
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,440
case you can use the remove method.
 so letters that

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,240
remove here we can remove B. and

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,670
this will remove the first
 occurrence of the letter b.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,340
So if you have multiple bs
 only the first one will be removed. If

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,740
you want to remove all bs in this list
 you will have to loop over this

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,300
list and remove each b individually. Now let's

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,340
run this code one more time so
 you can see b is gone. We

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,530
have another way to remove an
 item from a list and that

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,790
is using the del or delete statement.
 So here we

42
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,240
can delete an item by its index. We

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,460
can also delete a range of items.
 So this is

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,640
the difference between the delete statement and the

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,340
pop method. The pop method
 will remove only one item by

46
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,810
index. whereas with the delete
 statement we can remove a

47
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,240
range of items. 
And finally,
if you want to remove all

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,950
the objects in the list,
you should use the clear method.
Next we look at finding objects in the list.
