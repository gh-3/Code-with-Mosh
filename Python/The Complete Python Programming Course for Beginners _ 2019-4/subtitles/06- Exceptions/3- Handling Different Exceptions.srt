00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,960
Alright. 
I've simplified the code from the last lecture. 
Now let's extend this

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,520
example. Let's make up a magic formula. Like

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,240
X factor equals 10. Divided

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,330
by H. Save the changes back in

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,870
the terminal. Let's run this program one more time.
 I'm going to enter zero

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,480
as the h What happened. Our program crashed

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,960
again. 
We got a different kind of exception that

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,550
is a ZeroDivisionError,
 because in programming we

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,210
cannot divide a number by zero. 
So the

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,570
statement online 3 threw an exception. but

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,120
we don't have a matching except clause for

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,440
that kind of exception.
 In other words in this code

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,940
you're only handling ValueError exceptions and

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,330
that is why our program crashed. So to

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,870
solve this problem. we can
 come back here and add

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,260
a second except Klaus. Accept and

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,310
specify a different kind of
 exception in this case. zero

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,950
division error. Now below that.
 we can print a

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,490
message like Age cannot be zero back

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,560
in the terminal. Let's run the
 program one more time and enter zero

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,560
. Okay. beautiful.
 Our program didn't crash. Now let's

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,820
take this to the next level.
 Let's imagine if the

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,070
user enters zero for the age.
 We want to print the

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,860
exact same error message.
 So I want to copy this

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,760
and paste it here. Now our code looks

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,020
a little bit repetitive.
 We have repeated this message. and

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,170
that means if in the future we
 want to change this message. we have to

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,410
change it in two places.
 There is a better way to handle this

30
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,790
situation. 
In front of this except clause we

31
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,140
can specify multiple types of exceptions. 
So

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,060
if the exception that is
 thrown matches any of those exceptions

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,860
. then the code that we
 have in the except block will

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,020
be executed. So here we need to

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,970
add parenthesis to specify multiple types of exceptions

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,020
separated by comma. So come on. zero

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,070
division error and close parenthesis. Save

38
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,530
the changes. 
Now with this change, technically we don't

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,840
need these two lines.
We can delete them. 
But

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,390
temporarily I'm going to keep them
to show you something interesting. 
So

41
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,980
back in the terminal. 
let's run this one more time. 
And enter

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,260
zero. 
Note that we get a single error on the

43
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,540
terminal. 
In other words the code that

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,040
we have in this except block was

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,050
not executed, otherwise 
we would see this message twice. 
So

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,380
here's the lesson: 
when Python executes the code that

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,830
we have in the try block,
if any of the statements throws an

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,630
exception that matches one
 of the except clauses, that

49
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,300
except clauses executed and
 the other except clauses are

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,460
ignored. 
So to clean up this code 
we can delete these two lines; 
that is better.
