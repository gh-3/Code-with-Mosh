00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture you're going to learn how to work with json files in python.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a popular

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
way to format data in a human readable way. These days

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it's very important to know json because a lot of popular websites like Facebook

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Twitter, Yelp, YouTube, etc provide their data

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Jason format. Also, if you have a website, you can provide your

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
data in json format. So let me show you how to work

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with json files. On the top, import the json module.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now let's create an array of movie objects.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So movies we set it to array, each item in this array,

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is going to be a dictionary, because each movie object has properties like ID.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Title, year, and so on. So each movie is essentially

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a collection of key value pairs. So

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
let's add a dictionary the first key is id we map that to 1,

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the second is title, the second is title, we map that to

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Terminator, the third is year and map that to

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
let's say 1989. Now let's add

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
another object, change the ID to 2,

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
title to Kindergarten Cop, and year to

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
1993. So here we have the movies

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the object, now we can call json.dumps

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
pass this movies object here, and get a string that includes

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
movies data formatted as json. Let's take a look.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So data, you print it on the terminal,

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
there you go. So this is an example of json data.

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now in this case what you see here happens to be identical

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
syntax that we use to define an array of dictionary

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in python. But this is not the case when working with other languages.

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, back here so we have this data variable which is

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a simple string, now we can write it to a file, so on the top,

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
from the path lib module, let's import

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the path class. Then instead of printing

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
this on the terminal, we're going to create path object

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
let's say movies.json and then call

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
write text on it and pass this data string.

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let's run this program. Okay. Now here in our

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
project folder we have movies.json.

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Beautiful. So you learned how to write data in a json file.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now let's imagine we get this json file from somewhere else, this would be

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the data we get from Facebook, twitter, IMDB, Yelp

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
YouTube and so on. So we should be able to read this data in Python.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Back to app.py. I'm going to delete this movies array.

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
As well as the line where we dump it to a json string.

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So we start with this file, movies.json

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and read all it's text

46
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and store it in this variable. So now data is a string,

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that includes data formatted as json. Next we need to parse

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
this string into an array of objects. So we call json

49
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
.loads. Pass this string here,

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and this will return an array of dictionaries. Let's

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
call movies and print it on the terminal

52
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
so this is the movies array that we

53
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
had earlier. An array of dictionaries.

54
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So we can simply get any items in this array,

55
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
here's the first movie, now we have a dictionary, using a square bracket

56
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
we can get the value of any of these keys, for example let's get the

57
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
title of the first movie, run the program, we get

58
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
terminator, so this is all about working with json files in python.
