00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture you're going to learn how to work with SQLite in Python.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
SQLite is a very lightweight database that we use for storing data

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
on an application. It's often the technology of choice for

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
small applications like the apps that we run on phones and tablets. So it

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
allows us to easily store our data in a structure format with a table

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of rows and columns. So let's start by importing

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the sqlite3 module.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now in the last lecture we created this movies.json file. So

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
let's go ahead, read all the movies from the json file and go ahead and store them

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in our sqlite database. So, back

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in applic py we should also import json

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
module, and from the path lib module we should import

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the path class. Now,

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we create the path object, to load movies

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
.json file, read all it's content,

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this will give us a string, so we can pass that to json

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
.loads. And this will give us the list of

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
movies. Now, before going any further let's print

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this movies object and see if everything is working.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
up to this point. So let's run the application, beautiful,

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so we have a list of dictionaries, alright now we're going

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to store this list in a database, so

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this sqlite object has a method called connect

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we pass the name of our database file here,  let's call it db

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
.sqlite3 you could call it anything it doesn't matter.

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now if this file doesn't exist, this method will create it for us.

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, it will return a connection object,

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
this connection object, similar to files should be closed

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when you're done with it. So a batter approach is to use

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the with statement and then get the connection here.

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Next we need to create a command, this command is basically

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the structure we send to the database for creating data, updating data

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
deleting it and so on. Quite often we use a language called SQL,

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
thats beyond this scope of this course, so if you're not familiar with it, don't worry.

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's pretty easy to learn, in fact it's far easier then python, so

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
here's an example, I'm going to create a command and set it to a string

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
like this. inset into

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
movies I'm assuming we have a table called movies where we store

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
our movies. Then we add values

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
parenthesis, and in parenthesis I add three

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
question marks separated by a comma.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So this question marks our placeholders

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
for the values that we're going to supply in the next step, so our table of

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
movies will have three columns, id, title, and year.

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So next we need to iterate over our movies list

46
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that was pretty easy for movie in

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
movies now we need to execute this command,

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so we use our connection object, this has a method called

49
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
execute, as the first argument we pass our command

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and as a second argument we can pass the actual value.

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So each movie object in this for loop is

52
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a dictionary, it has key value pairs like id,

53
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
title, and year. All we want here is the actual year.

54
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, we call movie.values

55
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
now we need to get these values and put them

56
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in the tuple, so we use a built in

57
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
tuple function like this.

58
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So here we're iterating over our movies list, for each movie we execute

59
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
this command, when you're done we should call connection

60
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
.commit. At this point all these changes

61
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
will be written to the database, save the changes

62
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
now if we run this program we're going to get an error, so

63
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
there you go, operational error,

64
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
no such table movies.Â Because here  we're dealing with an

65
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
empty database this database doesn't have any tables so we need to create

66
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
a movies table first. Here in Google if we search for db

67
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
browser for sqlite. We will find this website,

68
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
sqlite browser.org, on this website we can find this application

69
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to open a sqlite database and look at it's content. As you can

70
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
see on the right side we have executables for various operating systems,

71
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
so go ahead and download the right executable for your operating system

72
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
when you open db browser, you're going to see something like this,

73
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
so on the top, let's go to open database, here you're going to

74
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
project directory, let's open our database file,

75
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
there you go, so as you see we don't have any tables here. Let's go ahead and

76
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
create a table, we're going to call that movies,

77
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and then we need to add three fields or three columns

78
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
so add field, the first one is id, the

79
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
type of this comment should be integer and we should mark this

80
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
as primary key, which means we're going to use the value of this column as

81
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a unique identifier of each movie. We want to make sure each movie has

82
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
a unique id. Okay? Now let's add

83
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
another field, we're going to call title, the top of this column

84
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
should be text, and finally in another

85
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
field we're going to call it here, once again the type of this is going to be integer,

86
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because here we're going to score values like 1984. So this

87
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is how we create the table, as you can see that's pretty easy let's go ahead

88
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
okay, now on the list of tables we have this movies table

89
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
we expand it and see all it's columns, it looks like I

90
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
made a mistake here, so the name of my third column is Field3,

91
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
there so let's select the table with a modified table,

92
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
here, then rename this column

93
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
field to year. Now press tab to make sure changes

94
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
are (?) by the way you also have this column here,

95
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
if we tick these check boxes, we are telling Sqlite that the

96
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
data in this column cannot be null. In other words we cannot

97
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
have a movie without the title or without the year, so it's better to check this as

98
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
well we don't have to check not null for the id field because

99
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
when we select a column as the primary key, sqlite will make sure

100
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that every row will have a value for that column. Alright let's go ahead

101
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
okay, were almost done, now we need to click

102
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
right changes beautiful, so, back

103
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to our program, let's run it one more time, okay, this time we

104
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
didn't get an error, so back to db browser, now if you select the movies

105
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
table, and go to browse data, you can see both our movies at

106
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
end up here, they're stored in a structure format, so you have a table with

107
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
columns and rows, it's beautiful, now let me show you how to read data

108
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
from this database. So we don't need line 5 anymore,

109
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
because we are done with this json file. To read data from a database,

110
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
first we need to connect to it, so, we're going to keep line 5, but we're going to

111
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
change line 6, so instead of inserting a movie,

112
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
into the movies table, we're going to select all the movies.

113
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The command that we should write is select star from

114
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
movies. Now, we don't need to iterate over the movies

115
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
object, we simply need to execute this command, so

116
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
connection.execute pass the command and this will return

117
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
a cursor, so when we read data from a database, we'll get a cursor.

118
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Now store that here, the cursor is an iterable object, so,

119
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we can iterate over it and get one row at a time, or row in

120
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
cursor let's simply print row, and we don't

121
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
need connection.commit because we only need this when writing data for database.

122
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So delete, save the changes, run the program,

123
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
you can see in each iteration we get a tuple of the

124
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
values for a row in our database,

125
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
we also have this method so cursor.fetch

126
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
all. Now we return all the rows in this table in one

127
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
go. So here we'll get a list, let's call that movies,

128
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and then print it on the terminal. Now if you run this for

129
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
we're not going to get any result, because after we iterate over this cursor,

130
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
we get to the end of the cursor, so we won't be able to read anything.

131
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Do I'm gonna comment out these two lines, save the changes and

132
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
run the program, now as you see we get the list of titles.

133
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, this is the basics of working with sqlite databases,

134
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
in python, as I told you when working with databases, you should

135
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
be familiar with the sql programming language that is beyond the scope

136
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of this course, but there are plenty of tutorials online and it's really easy

137
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.466
to learn.
