00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Python has a batteries included philosophy which means it comes with

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a comprehensive library of packages and modules that provide common feature

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we need when building real applications. So in this section

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we're going to explore python standard library more specifically you're going to learn

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how to work with files and directories SQLite databases

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
date/time objects, generate random values, send emails and so on.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now as you go through this section don't worry about memorizing anything just

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
try to give an idea of what is where and what we can do. We can

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
always come back to this section and treat it as a reference. For example,

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if in the future you want to generate random values you can come back and watch the

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
corresponding lecture.
