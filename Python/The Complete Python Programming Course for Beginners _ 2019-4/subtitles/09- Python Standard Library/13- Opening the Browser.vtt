00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture, you're going to learn how to open a web browser in a python script.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is particularly useful if you're building an automation script

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that does a bunch of tasks, and at the end you want to open up a browser window.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For example, let's say you want to build a script to deploy your website. So you

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
build your website locally on your development machine, when you're done, you

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
get deployed to a web server. At the end, you will have to open a browser

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
window, type the address of your website and press int. This is

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
manual and you can automate it, so you can have your python script, open up your web

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
browser at the end of deployment. So here let's print

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Deployment completed. Now to open a web

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
browser, we need to import the web browser module.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This module has this method called open,

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you simply pass the url of the target

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
web site, let's say google.com, now

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
when we run this program, we see this message here,

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the browser window opens, pointing to window.com.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So we don't have to manually type this.
