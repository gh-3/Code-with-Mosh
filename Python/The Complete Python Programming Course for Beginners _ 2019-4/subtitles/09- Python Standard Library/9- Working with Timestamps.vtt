Over the next few lectures, we're going to work with date and time

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in python. Basically we have two modules for working with date and time,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
one is the time module, which gives us a time stamp,

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the other is date time, which gives us date time objects

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with attributes like year, month, and so on. In this lecture we're going to

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
look at the time module, and we'll look at the day time module next,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so, this time module has a method called time,

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that returns the current date time as a time stamp. Let me show you. So,

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
print, the result this is what

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we get, this floating point number represents the number of seconds

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
from the beginning of time. I'm not talking about the big bang theory, that is

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the beginning of time on your operating system. On unix that is generated

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
first 9070, on windows honestly I'm not sure, so this

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
floating point number you see here, is the number of seconds after

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
January first 1970 which is referred to as unix epic

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
time. As you can see these timestamps are not human readable,

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so we use them to perform calculations. Here is an example.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm going to define a function to simulate sending an

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
email to 2000 recipients. So send emails

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
let's just do a for loop for i in range

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
10000 I'm going to do a pass here,

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
now, you're going to call this function but before

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
calling that, we're going to call time.time

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
get the current time, store it here, and

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
one more time after we send the emails. so time.time

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
values the end time, now we set

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
duration to end - start.

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Let's print the result, duration,

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so this is the amount of time it took to execute this function.

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now earlier in the course I also talked about the time it module

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we can also use that to calculate the execution time of

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
some piece of code. Both approaches are perfectly fine. So as you learn

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
more about python, or any other programming languages, you will realize there are

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
multiple ways to solve a problem. So these are time stamps in python,

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
next we'll look at date time objects.
