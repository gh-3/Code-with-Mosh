1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,470
mhm. Yeah. Earlier

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,410
. I told you that all the
 parameters that you define for a function are

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,990
required by default. In this lecture.
 I'm going to show you how

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,940
to make the by parameter optional. So let's

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,750
say we don't want
 to explicitly pass by equals

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,440
one. Every time we want
 to call this increment function. we

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,450
want to use this function
 to increment value by one. So

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,130
we removed the second argument.
 Now we need to give this parameter

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,750
a default value. so we
 set it to one. Now

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,720
. if we call this function
 and don't supply the second argument

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,980
. this default value will be used.
 Otherwise the value that

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,560
we specify here will be used.
 Let me show you. So we

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,390
run this program. The result is three. But

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,080
if we pass. the second argument here will

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,530
increment to buy five.
 so we will get seven so

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,250
you can see it's pretty easy
 to make a parameter optional. Just

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,060
be aware that all
 these optional parameters should come

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,560
after the required parameters. In other

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,510
words. I cannot add another required parameter

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,610
here. Let's call that another.
 I cannot add that here. If

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,250
I save the changes. you can see.
 we get a red underline

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,070
here. So all the optional parameters should

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,740
come after the required parameters. Now

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,380
. obviously. in this case.
 we don't need the second parameter. so let's
