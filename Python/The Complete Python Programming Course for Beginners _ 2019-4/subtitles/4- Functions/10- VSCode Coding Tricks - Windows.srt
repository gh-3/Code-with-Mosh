00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,510
mhm. Yeah. Alright

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,490
. let's finish up this section by
 looking at a few very useful shortcuts

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,060
for writing code fast. First.
 I'm going to show you the shortcuts for

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,860
Windows users. and in the next lecture.
 we'll look at the shortcuts format

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,820
. So if you're a Mac user.
 feel free to skip this lecture. So

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,210
here we are on Line nine and
 my cursor is right at the beginning of

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,160
the line. Let's say we want to move
 the cursor to the end of the line

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,060
. Instead of pressing the right arrow
 to go all the way to the end

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,690
. we can simply press the end key.
 and here's the cursor. Or

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,110
if you want to move the cursor to
 the beginning of the line. simply press the

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,310
home key. There you go. Similarly. if you

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,000
want to move the cursor to the
 beginning of the file press control and

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,650
home here it is. or control an end

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,410
to go to the end of the file.
 Now let's say we want to move this

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,800
line up instead of cutting
 it from here and then

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,060
copying it somewhere else.
 We can simply move it

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,790
up by pressing Ault and the up or

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,240
down arrows. Or. if you want
 to move these two lines up

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
and down. simply select them.
 then hold Ault and then up

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,250
or down. Very easy.
 Now. If you want to duplicate a

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,840
line or multiple alliance. simply select them now

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,330
. Hold down.
 shift hold and then press the

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,490
down key. We can duplicate it
 as many times as you want. There

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,740
you go. Here's another useful shortcut. If

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,990
you want to convert this line.
 or maybe these two lines into a comment. simply

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,740
hold down. Control and press Slash isn't

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,280
the same shortcut. You can remove
 the comment so you can target

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,790
it very easy. And finally.
 if you want to type the

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,480
name of a variable
 or function like multiply. you

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,230
don't have to type all characters.
 Here are a few ways to

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,230
type this quickly. You can
 just type the first few characters

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,730
. and here in the intelligence you can see that.
 So if you press enter. this

33
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,520
is what we call auto completion.
 Here's another way. So

34
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,790
instead of writing the
 first few letters. you can

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,980
just pick any letters
 in sequence and type them

36
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,520
so I can type em t
 y or I can just type M

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,640
p y or N Y.
 There you go. Here it

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,100
is. So I hope you
 enjoyed this shortcuts and thank
