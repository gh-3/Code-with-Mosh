00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
One of the questions that often
 comes in programming interviews is

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,440
the fizz buzz algorithm.
 You might be surprised that

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,460
there are a lot of developers out
 there with even the years of experience. but

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,410
they don't know how to
 solve this simple programming problem. That's

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,760
why I decided to include this
 in my course. So let's see how

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,240
this algorithm works. And then
 you can spend 10 to 15

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,690
minutes on this exercise on your own.
 So here we have a function face

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,940
buzz that takes an input.
 And depending on the

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,710
input we give it,
 it returns different results. Here

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,460
are the rules: 
If the input that we give it is divisible by

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,290
three, it will return the string Fizz. Let

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,770
me show you. So we run this program.
 We get Fizz. If

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,200
the input is divisible by five,
 it will return Buzz.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,760
Take a look.
 Here's Buzz. Now the third rule,

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,080
if the input is
 divisible by both three and five,

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,630
it will return FizzBuzz. So let's

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,080
pass 15 here. we'll get FizzBuzz.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,600
For any other numbers
 it will return the

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,070
same input. So if I pass seven, it's not

21
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,080
divisible by three or five,
 it will return seven

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,420
itself. So spend 10 to 15 minutes on this exercise.
You will see my solution next.
