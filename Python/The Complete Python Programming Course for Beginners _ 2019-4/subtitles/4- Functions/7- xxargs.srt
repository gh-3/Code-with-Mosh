1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,370
mhm. Yeah. So

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,720
in the last lecture.
 you learned the syntax to pass a

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,940
variable number of arguments
 to a function. We have

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,160
a variation of this
 syntax with double asterisk. and

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,640
that's what I'm going to show you
 in this lecture. So for this demo

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,990
. let's rename this function
 to save underlying user and

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,650
renamed the Argument to User. So let's imagine

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,250
we're going to use this function
 to save information about a user

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,800
now and this function. Let's just print this

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,370
user argument. We're done with our function. Let's

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,550
call it Save underline User. Now. instead of

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,770
passing arbitrary arguments here. we can pass arbitrary

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,930
keyword arguments. Remember keyword arguments. So we

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,190
have a name equals value. So here

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,160
we can add multiple
 keyword arguments like ID equals

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,200
one name equals John. Age

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,070
equals 22 so on.
 So we are passing three keyword

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,330
arguments to this function.
 Now let's run this program. This

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,360
is what we get. Look at the syntax.
 We have these curly braces

20
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,010
and in between them we have multiple key

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,140
value pairs. So key, colon, value, comma. Here's

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,560
another key value pair.
 And here is the last one.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,190
This object you see here
 is called a dictionary. It's another

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,450
complex type or a data
 structure in Python. and I'm

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,920
going to talk about that in
 detail later in the course. For now,

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,860
all I want you to take
 away is that when we use double asterisk

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,420
here, we can pass
 multiple key value pairs or

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,770
multiple keyword arguments to a function
 and python will

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,450
automatically package them into a dictionary. So

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,760
this user object here is
 a dictionary, now using the

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,750
bracket notation We can get
 the value of various keys

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,470
in this dictionary. 
So we can print user square

33
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,740
brackets. You pass a string
 and this is the name of

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,250
our key. Like I d
 Let's run the program. We

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,780
get one or we
 can access the value of

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,010
name key. Run the program. So name is
