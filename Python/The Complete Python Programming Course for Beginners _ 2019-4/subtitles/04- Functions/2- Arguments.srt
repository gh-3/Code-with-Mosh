1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,470
mhm. Yeah. Now

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,980
here's a question for you.
 What is the difference between the great and

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,380
print functions. The difference is that

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,870
this print function takes an input. whereas our

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,240
great function doesn't take any input.
 So let me show you

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,860
how to pass inputs like first
 name and last name to dysfunction

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,940
when defining a function, in between parenthesis we'll

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,990
list are parameters.
 So here we add two parameters,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,660
like first under
 line name and last underlie

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,890
name. Now when calling this function,
 we need to

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,600
supply two values for those parameters. We

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,040
refer to them as arguments. So Marsh

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,260
Hamedani. these are the
 arguments to the Greek function

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,470
. That's one of the terms that a
 lot of developers out there don't know. They

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,110
don't know the difference
 between parameters and arguments. A

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,090
parameter is the input that
 you defined for your function. whereas

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,950
an argument is the actual
 value for a given parameter.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,120
Okay. now let's change
 the line to and instead

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,920
of saying hi there. we can greet
 a person by their full name so

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,840
we can convert this
 to a formatted string and

21
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,240
past two fields here First name as well

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,140
as last name Save the changes run

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,090
the program. and this is
 what we get in terminal. Now

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,250
. This function is more useful.
 We can reuse it and call it

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,790
with different arguments. So that's great. John

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,650
Smith as well run the program so

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,470
we get high marks.
 Hamedani and High John Smith. Now,

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,650
note that by default all the
 parameters that you define for a

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,210
function are required. So here our greet function

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,860
takes two parameters. If I exclude one

31
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,110
of these arguments and save the changes. you

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,350
can see we have this red underline.
 So Pilot is

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,660
complaining and saying there is
 no value for argument last night

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,330
. Also. if we run the program.
 we get this type error. Greet

35
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,310
missing one required positional argument. So

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,610
let's put this back now.
 Later. I'll show you how
