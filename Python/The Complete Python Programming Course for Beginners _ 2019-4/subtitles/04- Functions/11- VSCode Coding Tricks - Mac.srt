1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,240
Mhm. Yeah. all

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,070
right. Now let's take a look
 at the shortcuts for Mac keyboard. So

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,270
here we are. online nine.
 and my cursor is right at the

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,440
beginning of the line. If you want
 to move the cursor to the end of

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,060
the line instead of using the
 right arrow to go all the

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,530
way. simply hold down
 the function key and press

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,550
right here it is.
 Or you can press function

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,170
and left to jump to
 the beginning of the light. Similarly

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,360
. you can press function
 and up to go to the

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,690
top of the file
 or function and down to

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,270
jump to the end of the file.
 Pretty useful. Now

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,660
let's say you want to move
 this line up instead of cutting it

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,230
from here and then copying it somewhere else.
 You can simply move

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,670
it up by holding
 down alt or option and

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,310
then pressing the up arrow are down very

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,570
easy. or we can select
 these two lines. Hold down the

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,860
altar option key. move it up or doubt

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,350
. Here's another useful shortcut.
 We can convert these two lines into

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,070
a comment by pressing command and slash. and

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,830
then we can remove the
 comment using the same shortcut so

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
we can target it. And finally.
 if you want to type the

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,410
name of a variable or
 function like multiply. you don't

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,680
have to type all the
 letters like multiply. That is

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,350
very slow. You can type
 the first few letters like malt

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
. and here in the intelligence.
 you can see it's selected. so press enter. or

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,690
you can pick any
 characters in sequence and type

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,100
them like M. T.
 Y. Here it is. Or you

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,650
can type M p y or M T

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,390
p so you can abbreviate
 it anyway you want. I
