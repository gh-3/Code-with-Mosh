1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,410
mhm. Yeah. So

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,570
far you have learned how to use
 some of the built in functions in

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,770
python. such as print round and

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,050
so on. In this section,
 you're going to learn how to write your

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,470
own functions. Now you might ask
 But why do we even need

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,680
to write our own functions?
 Well, when you build a

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,550
real program that program
 is going to consist hundreds

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,890
or thousands of lines of code.
 You shouldn't write all that

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,340
code in one file like we have
 done so far. You should break that

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,090
code into smaller, more maintainable and potentially

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,590
more reusable chunks.
 We refer to these chunks as

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,220
functions. so let me show
 you how to create your own

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,280
custom functions. We start with the def keyword,

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,870
which is short for define.
 Next, We need to give our function a

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,240
name. So let's call this greet. all the

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,750
best practices you learn about
 naming your variables also apply to

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,080
naming your functions. so make
 sure your function names are meaningful

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,490
. Descriptive. Use lower case
 letters to name your functions and

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,550
an under square to separate multiple words. Now

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,620
. after the name we need to add parenthesis.
 you will see why shortly

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,040
and then we'll add a corner. Now what

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,850
is going to happen. You know it.
 We're going to get indentation. which

23
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,250
means the following statements will
 belong to this function. So

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,740
here I'm going to add two statements. Hi

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,460
there. And welcome aboard

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,330
. Both designs belong to
 this function because they're indented. Now

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,840
we're done with this function.
 We need to call it so we

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,120
remove the indentation and we add two line

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,940
breaks after this function.
 This is what Pep8 recommends

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,440
to keep our code clean and maintainable.
 Now. if you forget

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,280
to add to line breaks. don't worry.
 As soon as you save the changes. Auto

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,650
Pep eight will automatically add
 these line breaks for you. Let

33
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,680
me show you. So I'm going
 to remove these line breaks and

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,140
call this function great with parenthesis. just like

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,570
how we call the built in functions.
 Now. save the

36
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,810
changes. There you go. So we get to

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,050
line breaks after our function. Now let's run

38
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,500
this program. So we get these
