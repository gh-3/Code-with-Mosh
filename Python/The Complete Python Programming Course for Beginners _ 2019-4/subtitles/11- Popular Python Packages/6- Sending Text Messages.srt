2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,950
In this lecture I'm going to teach you 
How to send text messages using TWILIO.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,890
TWILIO is a very popular communication platform for

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,410
adding voice, video and messaging to our applications. 
For

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,330
example, you can quickly 
make and receive video calls, 
send

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,600
text messages, and 
this is particularly useful for confirming reservations, 

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,270
sending appointment reminders or promotions.
The possibilities are

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,120
endless. 
They provide an API that is perfectly documented

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,870
and it's super easy to use. 
So we can directly communicate with

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,230
this API by sending http requests using the

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,460
request module. 
But they also provide a library that

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,960
we can install using pip or penv.
This library

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,510
is essentially a wrapper around their API. 
So

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,370
it gives us objects, and 
these objects encapsulates all

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,960
that http communication, so 
we no longer have to work at

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,880
a low level of sending
http requests to twilio API,

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,860
we work at a higher level, 
in a more abstract and 
simplified fashion.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,730
Their objects, 
these objects have methods,
recall them and they

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,410
internally will take care of
sending the right http requests to

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,650
twilio api. 
All right. 
so the first thing you need to do is

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,700
to create a twilio account. 
Let's go to the sign up page. 
Here

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,070
we have a simple form. 
You need to provide your First Name, Last Name

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,350
Email and Password. 
On the next page, It's going to ask you

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,530
to provide a phone number, and 
this is used to verify your

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,040
account. 
So pause the video and do these steps when you're done, come

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,520
back continue watching. 
Okay

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,960
so here we are on twilio console. 
On the left side,

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,140
let's go to phone numbers.
we need to provision a

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,650
phone number for 
sending text messages or 
making phone calls.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,950
So let's click "Get Started" and

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,870
then click "Get your first Twilio phone number". 
All

32
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,790
right. 
This is the number we're going to use to send a text message in the

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,370
next step. 
So let's go ahead and 
choose this number. 
Beautiful.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,750
We have set up our account.
Now we are ready to write a program to send

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,040
a text message using Twili. 
So let's start

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,360
by creating a brand new project.
We're going to call that PyText.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,490
Now let's go to this folder and

38
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,920
open it in VSCode. 
All

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,550
right. 
Here first we need to install Twilio. 
So pipenv

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,620
install twilio. 
Okay.

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,350
Beautiful. 
Now let's add a new file here, We

42
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,450
call it app dot py. 
Next we

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,100
need to select our virtual environment.
So we can either click this

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,760
virtual environment on the status bar
or we can press

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,380
shift command and p on Mac or 
shift control

46
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,050
p on windows. 
Here we search for python

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,460
interpreter. There you go. So let's select that, and

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,960
we set this to PyText. 
Okay.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,360
Now from twilio dot rest

50
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,710
we need to import the client class. So

51
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,370
this class represents a client to twilio rest

52
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,410
API. 
Now let's create a client object. Here

53
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,680
We need to pass an account_sid,
which is short for security identier

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,060
as well as an authentication token.
We can find both

55
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,440
these on twilio console. 
So here on twilio

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,280
console, on the top,
you can see the PROJECT NAME, right

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,200
below that we've got ACCOUNT SID or security Identifier

58
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,690
Let's copy this. 
Now back In VSCode. Here

59
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,230
I'm going to store this in a separate variable. 
So later we can export

60
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,700
this and put it in a separate module. 
So account

61
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,990
sid we set it to this string. Now

62
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,300
back to twilio consol, below
 accounts it We've got authentication

63
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,460
token. So let's view that, copy and

64
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,450
then similarly 
we're going to store it in a separate variable, so auth

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,540
underlying token, we set it to this string. 
Now

66
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,990
we create a client object and 
pass account_sid as

67
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,570
well as the authentication token. 
And here's

68
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,200
our client object. 
This client object has a few interesting

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,040
attributes. 
The one that we're going to look at in this lecture is messages,

70
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,440
and we use that to send text messages. 
We also have calls

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,420
for making voice calls.
 We've got fax, video, chat

72
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,880
and so on. 
So messages. 
Now

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,030
this object has a method called create. Here

74
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,860
We need to pass three pieces of information. 
to

75
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,870
which we set to a phone number, 
from

76
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,690
underline which we set to our twilio number. 
This

77
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,260
is the phone number that we generated earlier. 
And

78
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,670
finally body, let's

79
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,180
say "This is our first message".
So with only

80
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,860
four lines of code we can 
easily send a text message to

81
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,110
any numbers in the world.
 This create method takes care of

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,160
sending the right http request to twilio api. 
So

83
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,690
finally it will return a call object. 
This call 

84
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,310
object has attributes, like

85
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,550
date_created, date_sent, date_updated and so

86
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,800
on. 
So this was the

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,300
basics of sending text messages using TWILIO. 
Now earlier

88
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,670
when we consume the yelp api, 
I told you that you should not store

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,400
this kind of information in your source code
and then check it into a version control

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,850
system like git. 
So as a best practice, we should

91
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,100
take these two variables out, 
put them in a separate file and then

92
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,250
exclude that file from our version control system. 
But I'm

93
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:02,000
not going to do that, because 
you already know how to do it and 
I don't wanna waste your time repeating what you already know.
