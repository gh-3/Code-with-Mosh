00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this lecture we're going to have a
 quick look at yelp a P I. So

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,450
if you search for Yelp API.
 you can find this website yelp dot

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,050
com slash developers. Let's have a quick look

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,790
here. So we have this yelp fusion

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,310
. which is the
 rest api for yelp. when

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,850
working with APIs quite
 often you see this term rest. which

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,050
is basically a technical jargon
 that stands for representational state

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,320
transfer. Basically. it's a
 bunch of conventions and rules

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,900
that we have to follow to
 build or consume APIs for

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,850
exchanging data. So let's take
 a look at this yelp fusion

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,970
on this page. You should
 see this documentation link. Here

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,780
we have various end points
 for working with businesses. For example

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,690
. we have endpoints for
 finding businesses by keyword location

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,940
category or using a phone number.
 We also have

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,060
an endpoint forgetting details
 about a particular business or

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,690
reviews. These are all business endpoints now on

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,260
the left side. If you look.
 we also have 10

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,250
points for working with events
 as well as categories. So

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,560
there are so many different things that we
 can do with Yelp. a P I no

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,810
to get started. First.
 we should create an app. So let's

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,650
give our application a name.
 I'm gonna call this pie. Yup

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,890
. Now. if we do have a website.
 we can put that here. But in this case

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,740
. we don't have a website.
 We simply have a python program. Next

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,960
. We need to specify
 the industry for this application. I'm

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,240
going to set that to business.
 The next piece of

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,060
information admitted to supply is
 the contact email and some description

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,770
. So I'm going to
 type programming with Marsh at

29
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,340
gmail dot com and some description.
 It doesn't really matter

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,480
. We can always come back and
 change this in the future. So obviously

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,570
. we need to accept their terms and conditions.
 And I don't want to

32
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,220
get any emails about their
 product news and so on. So

33
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,990
let's go ahead with this and create

34
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,850
a new app. All right. Our applications created

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,540
Now we have a client ID that uniquely identifies our

36
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,110
application. This is like a
 user name for an application. We

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,780
also have an API key.
 which is kind of like a password for

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,110
an application. We'll need
 this API key whenever we

39
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,720
want to talk to any of the
 endpoints on Yell. This is for security. So

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,500
Yelp wants to know who's
 calling their API endpoints. With

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
this basic information that we provided.
 at least they have a contact information. They

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,870
know who is the creator of this application.
 All right. we have created our

43
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:51,000
application. 
Next I'm going to show you 
How to send an http request to yelp API 
to get the list of buisinesses.
