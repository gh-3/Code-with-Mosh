2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,530
So in our current implementation.
 we have stored the api key in

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,730
our source code. There's a problem with this.
 If you have this

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,880
code for version control system
 like get and publish it

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,150
to get to this API key is visible to anyone who

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,650
has access to that Git hub repository.
 And that means

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,290
they can create an application
 and malicious application and use

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,190
our API key to pretend to be us.
 That's not good. So

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,060
if they violate. any of the policies
 of Yelp we';; be in trouble. So

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,440
How to prevent this?
 Well. we need to extract this

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,890
API key. put it in a
 separate file and exclude that file

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,160
from get Let me show you
 how to do that. So that's

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,560
pretty easy. We add a
 new file here. Let's call that

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,870
config. That pie in this
 file will have all kinds

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,310
of configuration parameters or applications. So now

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,670
back to after pie.
 I'm going to move line for into

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,810
conflict that pie so cut. then we'll

18
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,110
be here. Save the
 changes now back to after

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,350
the pie on the top. we import this

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,780
conflict module in this module.
 we have an attribute called

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,130
api key. right.
 So we can access it using

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,600
the data operator. So this
 is where we're referencing the API

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,250
key. We need to
 prefix that with config dot

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,340
That was the first step.
 Now. to exclude this file

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,030
from git, 
we need to come to our project, 
add

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,250
a new file and
call it dot gitignore.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,170
Here we can specify what
 files and directors should be excluded from

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,670
our git repository. So currently. that

29
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,660
is config that point save the changes. So

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,200
now when we push our code to git hub Repository, 
our config file

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,940
will not be there. 
So if you're working in a team, every developer

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,150
needs to create this conflict file on their own machine. 
So it's

33
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:05,000
the responsibility of the team leader
who has access to the API key, 
to give the API key to every developer in the team.
