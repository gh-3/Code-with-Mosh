1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,410
in this section. We're going to look

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,870
at some of the most popular
 packages in the python community. So

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,760
you're going to learn how to
 work with Excel spreadsheets. Pdf fires

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,480
. send text messages. automate browsers. scrape

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,740
websites and so on.
 These have a lot of applications in

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,020
the real world before we get started.
 I just want to let you know that

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,240
we're only going to look at the
 basics of these packages because each of

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,410
these packages has so much detail
 that goes beyond the scope of

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,110
this course. You need to look at
 their documentation to learn these additional details

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,920
on your own. So in this section.
 I just want to show you what is out

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,170
there for you and how you can use it.
 Now. As you go through this

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,660
section. it is possible that some
 of these packages may not work

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,210
on your machine. As you see in these videos.
 there are basically two reasons

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,280
. If this happens. the first reason
 is that you didn't follow the instructions exactly

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,700
as I showed you in the video.
 Maybe you had a typo or you missed a

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,590
space or you didn't use
 the lowercase or uppercase letters exactly

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,620
like how I type. So first.
 make sure to follow each step exactly

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,830
as I show you. Now.
 if you still encounter an error. then

19
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,230
chances are there is something wrong
 on your machine. And unfortunately. I

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,450
won't be able to help you with that
 because every machine is different. I don't know

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,530
what software you have installed or whether
 you have changed any of the configuration settings

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,050
. So you need to resolve this
issue on your own. 
How? 
All you

23
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,350
have to do is simply copy
 paste the error messages you get. And

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,480
Google. I can promise you
 are not the only person on

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,800
this planet who encountered these problems.
 I'm pretty sure

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,220
there are other people who have faced
 the same situation. You're not the first one

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,470
or the only one in the
 world with all that. Let's get

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,840
started. Yeah. yeah
