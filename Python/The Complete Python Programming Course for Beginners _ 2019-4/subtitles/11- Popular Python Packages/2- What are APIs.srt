2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,470
These days a lot of websites make
 their data available to others while

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,710
what we call application programming
 interfaces or APIs.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,260
In simple terms
 these APIs are endpoints that

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,520
are publicly accessible on the Internet.
 So they have URLs

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,760
just like the
 Web sites themselves. Here is

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,200
an example, 
on yelp we have this API for searching for

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,860
businesses. 
And this API has an endpoint at

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,180
this address or u r
 l that is api dot yelp

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,960
dot com slash version
 three slash businesses slash search

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,620
so we can send an http
 request to this end point to

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,110
get the list of businesses
 that match some criteria. In

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,150
case you're not familiar with http.
 it's basically the protocol that

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,540
powers our web. So as
 we're browsing the web. our

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,940
browser sends http requests various websites and

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,650
get something back. Let me show you.
 So here in chrome. on

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,490
the top from the view menu.
 go to developer and

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,910
open up develop are tools. Now

19
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,880
open up the network tab.
 In case you don't see anything here. press

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,490
command and are on mac
 or control and are on windows

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,340
to refresh the page. There you go. So

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,560
these are all the http
 requests that my browser sent to

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,540
yell. Look at the
 first request business search. That's

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,110
a request to get a document. Let's inspect

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,100
this request here in the header step.
 you can see various attributes of

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,360
an http request. So this is the request.
 U r l or

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,140
address. And that is the end point where

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,540
we're sending this request to. 
Every http request has

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,910
a method. and that method
 determines what we're going to

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,470
use this request for We
 have a few standard http

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,480
request methods get for getting data post

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,200
for creating data put for updating data and

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,340
delayed for deleting data
 below the request method. We

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,560
have status code. and that
 is the status code of the

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,530
response that we get from the Web.
 Server 200 indicates

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,430
success. Now here. If you
 look at the response tab. you

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,570
can see the response that
 this Web server sent to our

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,440
browser. This is basically
 an HTML document that represents

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,770
its web page. If you
 open the previous tab. you can

40
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,160
see a preview of this Web page. So

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,920
over the next few lectures you're
 going to learn how to communicate with

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,140
yelp. AP to search for businesses based on some criteria.
