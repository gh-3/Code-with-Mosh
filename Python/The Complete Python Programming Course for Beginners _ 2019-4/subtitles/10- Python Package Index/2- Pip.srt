2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,060
To install a package from Pypi, 
we use a tool called Pip.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,860
Now If you're on Mac similar to Python,
 you should use Pip3.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,720
Now With this tool we can do various things
such as installing packages,

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,270
uninstalling them, upgrading them,
 or listing the currently installed

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,660
packages. 
Let's take a look at a few examples. 
So

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,760
here to install a package, 
as the first argument we pass install

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,470
and as the second argument we specify
the name of the target package. 
So

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,090
here I'm going to install this requests package which

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,540
we're going to use to send http requests. 
So let's

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,060
go ahead. 
All right.

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,240
This is successfully installed, 
but here down the bottom we have a

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,960
warning in yellow that is saying 
you're using pip version 10

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,720
However version 18 is available.
 So this version

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,340
10 is the version that came
with my python installation. 
But because

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,580
pip is developed independently, 
we need to upgrade it from

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,100
time to time. 
So right below that you can see the command that

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,760
you need to run to upgrade Pip that

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,660
is PIB Install Dash dash upgrade

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,890
Pip. 
All

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,090
right. Now I have the latest version of Pip. 
Let's look at

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,650
the packages that are currently installed on my machine. 
So pip

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,230
list. 
Here in

24
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,690
this list you can see we
 have installed the version 2.20 point

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,890
one of the requests package.
This version you see

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,450
here is what we call semantic versioning.
The first number

27
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,210
represents the major version.
The second number represents the

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,620
minor version. 
and the third number represents the patches or

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,720
bug fixes. 
Now back on pypi dot org. 
let's

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,820
search for the request package. 
So here we

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,310
have a few packages with a similar name.
 We've got requests, requests3

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,920
and requests2 
and they're not always in the same order, 
so

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,480
make sure to pick the requests package without

34
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,100
2 or 3. 
Now on this page on

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,740
the left side you can see
the release history of this package. 
So

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,120
the latest version that I have installed is 2.20 point one

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,690
at the time of recording this video.
There are times that you want to install an

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,450
earlier version. 
Perhaps the latest version has a bug or

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,430
is incompatible with the
other packages you're referencing. 
So

40
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,120
let me show you how to install an earlier version. 
So

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,620
back on the terminal. 
Let's say we want to install version 2.9 point

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,960
zero. 
That is very easy.
Just like before Pip install

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,050
requests. Now we add to equal sign

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,800
followed by the version 2.9 point zero. 
So

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,220
as you can see
this successfully uninstalled the latest version

46
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,250
that was version 2.20 point one and 
then installed version

47
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,920
2.9 point zero. 
Now here we can also use wild

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,650
cards. 
For example pip install requests

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,070
equal 2.9 point asterisk. 
That

50
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,470
means installed the latest compatible version with

51
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,770
version 2.9. 
So if there are any patches or bug fixes

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,110
include those as well. 
Now

53
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,610
here on pypi dot org 
you can see we have three 2.9 versions

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,470
This is the base version,
 and then we got a couple more versions before

55
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,960
version 2.10. 
So when I run this command pip will

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,590
install the latest compatible version with 2.9 point

57
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,010
zero which is 2.9 point two. 
Let's

58
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,440
take a look.
Now we've got this message "Requirement

59
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,750
already satisfied" because we already have version 2.9

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,230
point zero installed. 
So first we need to uninstall it before we

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,860
install the latest compatible version with this. 
So

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,530
that is very easy. 
pip, this

63
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,040
time we're going to use uninstall and then requests. 
We

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,440
don't care about the version. 
This is asking

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,410
for confirmation. 
so let's go ahead. 
Now Requests Version

66
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,690
2.9 point zero is uninstalled. 
So now let's

67
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,640
install requests Version

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,270
2.9 point asterisk. 
This will install

69
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,830
the latest compatible version with 2.9. 
We

70
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,990
also have another syntax for installing the latest compatible version.

71
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,350
So instead of two equal sign, we use a

72
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,800
tilde equal sign.
And then here we specify a

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,830
specific version. 
Let's say 2.9 point zero. 
Once

74
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,170
again this will install the latest compatible version with

75
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,990
2.9 point zero, which

76
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,290
is 2.9 point two.
Now we can use this

77
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,770
asterisk with the minor version as well. 
For example

78
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,750
let me uninstall this first.
 so pip uninstall

79
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,360
requests. 
Okay. 
let's go ahead.

80
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,380
Good. 
Now pip install

81
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,240
requests two point asterisk. 
This

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,760
will install the latest compatible version with version two.

83
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,650
So back to the release history.
If your scroll to the very top,

84
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,250
you can see the latest compatible version with version two is 2.20

85
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,860
point one. 
Let's go ahead and run this.

86
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,110
There you go.
So we successfully installed requests

87
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,390
to 0.20 point one. 
Now we can use

88
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,130
this package just like the modules and python standard library.

89
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,960
So we import requests. 
Now

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,500
we have a module object with these

91
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,040
members. 
You can read about this on the documentation for

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,840
this package. 
So back on pypi dot org. 
Here

93
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,550
on the page for the request package,
If you scroll down, you

94
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,440
can see a link to the documentation. 
Now

95
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,600
back to our code. 
I'm going to call the get method. 
Let's

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,010
send an http request to google dot

97
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,040
com. 
This returns a response object. 
For

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,910
now let's simply print the response on the terminal. 
Let's

99
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:23,000
run the program.
So we got a response with the status two hundred 
which indicates success.
