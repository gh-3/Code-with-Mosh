00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,670
In the last section we explored Python Standard Library. 
Now even

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,010
though this library is very comprehensive,
 it doesn't have everything that

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,150
we potentially need when building a real application. 
There

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,840
are times that we need 
features not implemented in Python Standard 

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,610
Library. 
That's where pypi or PYthon Package Index

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,000
comes into the picture. 
pypi is like NPM or Node

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,380
Package Manager for JavaScript developers. 
It's basically a

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,810
repository of python packages built by people like

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,210
you and I. 
So if you head over to pypi dot org, on

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,190
this page you can see that
 currently we have almost 160,000 projects

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,350
registered in this repository.
For pretty much anything you

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,520
imagine, there is a python package here. 
Let's say

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,940
you want to work with PDF files in your application. 
Simply search

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,360
for pdf here. 
As you can see currently

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,710
we have over 2000 projects for working

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,550
with PDF files. 
Here are a few examples. 
This first package

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,270
is a two dimensional barcode generator.
We also have

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,670
this package for managing and processing pdf files. 
The

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,030
next one is for converting a PDF file to text. 
We

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,330
can also convert a pdf to image and so on. 
So

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,860
we have tons and tons of packages for working with PdF files.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,650
Of course not all of these are useful. 
Some of them are buggy or

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,140
incomplete. 
But if you do a little bit of research, you can find a

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,570
good and stable package for your projects. 
Alternatively you

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,910
can also google the best python packages for working with

27
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,000
pdf files and see what other people in the community say. 
So

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,610
in this section you're going to learn about 
all the tooling you need to install

29
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,820
these packages and publish
 your own packages to this

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,310
repository. 
Are you excited? 
All right, now let's get started.
