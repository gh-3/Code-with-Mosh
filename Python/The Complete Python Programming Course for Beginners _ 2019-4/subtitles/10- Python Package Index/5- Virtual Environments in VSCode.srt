2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,080
So in the last lecture, 
I didn't run this program using the code runner. I

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,220
used the terminal. 
Now let's see what happens when we were

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,880
on this program using the code runner extension. 
So there

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,670
you go. 
We get the same error,
No module named

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,040
requests, because Code Runner is running this program using

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,350
the python interpreter that is installed globally, 
and

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,240
that python interpreter cannot 
find the requests module. 
To

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,320
fix this problem, We need to tell code Runner to 
use the python interpreter

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,420
in our virtual environment. 
So back in

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,960
the terminal.
let's find the virtual environment directory for this project,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,870
pipenv Dash Dash venv. 
There

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,530
you go. 
Now let's open this. 
So

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,710
this is our directory structure that you have seen before. 
Here in

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,260
this virtual environment inside of the bin folder, we've

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,220
got python3. 
If you're on Windows, you have python. 
So

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,400
we need to get the past so
 this python interpreter and give it to the

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,730
code runner extension. 
Back in VSCode, on the

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,460
top, let's go to the code menu.
 then preferences and

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,100
settings. Here. click this dot. dot. dot

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,220
An open settings that Jason if

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,450
you scroll down somewhere here. you should see

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,890
Code Runner that execute her map. We said

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,880
this earlier in the course in
 case you missed that step. Simply add

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,230
a new key value pair.
 Here. The key is code that

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,060
runner that execute er map. When

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,010
you press enter. it automatically
 generates all these settings. Now

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,300
. here we have the
 path to Python. As you

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,510
can see. I've changed this
 to Python three. Now we need

30
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,770
to replace this with the
 past to the Python interpreter in

31
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,190
a virtual environment.
 So this is the path our

32
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,900
virtual environment. 
Let's copy this. 
then back

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,560
to user settings and

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,480
replace this with this past slash Bin

35
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,510
slash. So we're referencing the python interpreter in

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,910
our virtual environment that save the changes back

37
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,130
to abduct pie. Let's run
 this program using the code runner

38
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,310
extension. There you go. So

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,520
we fixed the issue with code Runner.
 but we have a read on the line

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,170
here unable to import requests. 
So

41
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,360
VSCode cannot find our requests module. 
To

42
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,900
fix this problem, we need to tell VSCode which 
python interpreter to

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,870
use. 
Now if you look at the status part here, you can see Python

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,020
3.7. 
Click this. 
In this list you

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,960
should see various Python interpreters.
Now look at the last one here. 
This

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,870
is the path to the python interpreter in a virtual environment. 
If

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,980
you don't see this on your machine,
 you need to go back to the user settings

48
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,460
page and add

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,120
a new setting that is python dot

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,960
python pass. We said this to the

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,680
past to the Python interpreter
 in a virtual environment. So

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,290
let's pace the path to
 the virtual environment. then slash

53
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,070
bin slash python three. 
Now

54
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,500
after we add this,
we need to restart VSCode. 
Then

55
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,310
when we go back to app.py,
here in the list of virtual environments,

56
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,850
you should see this new python interpreter. 
So let's

57
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,600
select this. 
You can see the compilation error is gone. 
but

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,590
we got this other error 
Linter pylint is not installed, 
because

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,530
earlier we install this globally,
and now it's not available in this isolated

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,430
virtual environment. 
So we need to go ahead and install

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,880
it here. 
All right. 
The error is gone.
