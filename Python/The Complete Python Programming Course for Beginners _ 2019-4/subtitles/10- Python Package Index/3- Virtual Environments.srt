2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,150
In the last lecture you learned 
how to install a package using pip. 
Now

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,880
let's run pip list. You

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,000
can see currently we have installed requests version 2.20.1

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,340
There is a problem here.
Let's say we have another

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,770
project and in that project we 
want to use an earlier version of

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,620
this package. 
With the current structure we cannot have two versions

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,020
of any of these packages side by side. 
We can have only

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,700
a single version. 
To solve this problem, we need to create an

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,210
isolated virtual environment for each application and

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,520
install these dependencies into that virtual isolated environment.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,010
Let me show you how to do that. 
So here in

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,040
the project folder,
we run Python Dash m venv 

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,840
and then specify the name of a directory for containing

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,950
this virtual environment.
By convention we call that env.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,830
Now don't worry about memorizing any of these
 because later I'm going to show you a

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,110
better and simpler way. 
So technically you're never going to execute this

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,180
command after I show you the latest tools.
I'm just going to

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,990
take you on a step by step journey.
So you understand exactly how

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,500
these various tools come together. 
So let's

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,880
go ahead and run this command. 
Good. Now

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,250
here on the file Explorer panel,
you can see we have a new directory and

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,020
in this directory we have this conflict file with these

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,460
parameters: 
home is referencing the directory where my

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,870
python interpreter is installed,
and here's

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,260
the version of that interpreter.
So I'm using C Python version 3.7.

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,360
We also have this bin or binary directory where

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,020
we have a bunch of tools like pip, pip3, python,

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,320
python3 and so on.
Next to that we have includ which is

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,760
currently empty. 
You have lib, inside of

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,060
this directory we have python3.7 and inside

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,650
of that we have site-packages.
Now this directory

33
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,400
structure is slightly different on Windows.
So if you're a Windows user,

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,680
don't get hung up on these subtle differences. 
Focus on the big

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,370
picture. 
What matters here is that this site-packages

36
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,780
directory is where, we'll install the packages for

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,110
this application. 
So a virtual directory is an

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,940
isolated environment where we have a specific Python interpreter,

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,330
in this case C Python version 3.7, as well

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,090
as a bunch of packages that this application needs. 
Okay

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,700
now that we have a virtual environment, 
we need to activate it. 
Here

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,550
in the bin folder we have the script called activate. 
We

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,130
need to run this from the terminal. 
So back

44
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,890
in the terminal. 
if you're on windows,
you execute this script directly

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,040
So you reference it like this env backslash bin

46
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,080
back slash activate that bat. 
If

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,110
you're on Mac or Linux,
you will have to type source env

48
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,390
slash bin slash activate. 
There

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,480
you go. 
Now we can see the name of the currently active virtual

50
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,770
environment, in this case that is env. 
We could

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,240
call this anything but by convention we use env. 
So

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,660
now that we are in the virtual environment for this application, 
let's go

53
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,790
ahead and install an earlier version of requests package. 
So

54
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,550
pip install requests 2.9

55
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,130
point asterisk. 
So

56
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,840
as you can see,
we have installed requests version 2.9

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,960
point two which is different
 from the request package that we

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,380
installed globally on this machine.
This is specific to

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,510
this application. 
Now back to our directory 

60
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,300
structure. 
Now under the site-packages directory, we

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,520
have this new directory requests.
 This is where we

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,880
have installed the request package for this application. 
Finally

63
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,620
whenever we're done,
we need to deactivate this virtual environment

64
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,000
So we run deactivate. 
Done.
