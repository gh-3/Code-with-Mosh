2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
So you have learned the basics of pipenv.
Now let's take a look at a

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,860
few useful commands for managing
the dependencies of our application. 
We

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,210
can run pipenv graph 
to see the list

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,760
of all the installed dependencies.
So currently we have installed requests

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,020
version 2.20 point one and 
below that

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,190
you can see 
the dependencies of the requests package itself. 
In

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,970
front of each dependency, 
you can see the version that was required by

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,620
the requests package, as well as
the version that is installed on

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,740
our machine. 
Now let's uninstall the requests package.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,790
So pepenv uninstall requests. 
So

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,300
the request package is gone.
If you look at the Pipfile, it's

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,350
not here anymore. 
Also if we run pipenv graph

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,360
it's gone. 
However the dependencies of

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,630
the request package are still
 here because pipenv doesn't know

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,940
if these dependencies are used 
somewhere in our application or not. 
However,

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,410
if we take this project,
put it on a different machine, and 
install all

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,260
these dependencies from scratch, 
these packages will not end up there because

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,600
currently we have not referenced them in our Pipfile. 
Now

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,210
let's install an earlier version of the requests package. 
So

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,990
pipenv install requests version

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:31,710
2.9 point asterisk. 
All

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,010
right. 
Now in our Pipfile, you can see we

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,350
have the request package with the version that we have requested, 
and

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,280
if you look at Pipfile dot lock,
you can see the actual

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,650
version that is installed;
that is 2.9 point two.

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,680
Now to find the outdated packages,
we can run pipenv

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:58,330
update dash dash outdated. 
We

29
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,400
get this yellow warning "Skip Update of Package requests". 
So

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,750
this is the version that we have installed.
As you can see, there

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,350
is a newer version available,
but pipenv won't be able to install

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,230
that, 
because in our Pipfile we asked for the most recent version

33
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,950
compatible with 2.9
So 2.20 may

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,090
not be compatible with 2.9
So let's

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,340
go to our Pipfile.
Let's change this to two

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,170
point asterisk. 
So we are asking for the latest compatible

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,800
version with version two. 
Now let's

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,370
run this command one more time. 
This

39
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,100
time we don't see the yellow warning anymore. 
Package 'requests' is

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,540
out-of-date,
this is the version that is installed and 
this

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,960
is the version that is available.
Now we have two choices: 
We

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,940
can update this package or
all packages in our project. 
To

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,650
update all packages we run pipenv update,
And

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:03,600
to update a specific package,
we add its name here, so requests. 
Okay

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,460
Now all our dependencies are up to date. 
So

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,520
if you look at Pipfile dot lock, you

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,610
can see that we have requests version 2.20 point

48
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,550
one. 
And similarly if we run pipenv graph,

49
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,960
you can see that 
we have installed 
the latest version of the requests package.
