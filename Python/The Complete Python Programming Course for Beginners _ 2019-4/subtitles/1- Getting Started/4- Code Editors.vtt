00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When it comes to typing Python code, you have two options:

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can use a *code editor* or an *IDE*

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is short for: Integrated Development Environment.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
An IDE is basically a code editor with some fancy features like

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
autocompletion, which means as you type code this feature

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
helps you complete your code, so you don't have to type every character by hand.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a productivity boosting feature. It also gives you additional

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
features like debugging which means finding and fixing bugs in your

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
programs. Testing and so on. For both code editors and

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
IDE's there are so many options out there, the most popular code editor out there

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
are VS code, Atom, and Sublime. You can use

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the code editor that you prefer. In terms of the IDE's again

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
there are so many options out there, the most popular one is Pycharm

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In this course, I'm going to use VSCode, or Visual Studio Code,

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because that's my favorite code editor. Later in the course I will show you

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
how to install a plugin or an extension that will convert vs code

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
into a powerful IDE. So before going any further head over

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to code.visualstudio.com and download the latest

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.100
version of VSCode.
