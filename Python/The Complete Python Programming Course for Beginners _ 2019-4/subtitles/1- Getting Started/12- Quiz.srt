00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
So I've got a few questions for you, 'cause

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,500
I wanna see if you have been really paying attention to

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
this video or not.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,900
You better have. so here's the first question. for each question

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,600
I want you to pause the video, think about the answer for

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,400
a few seconds, when you're ready continue watching.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,000
So here's the first question:

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,800
What is an expression?

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,900
An expression is a piece of code that produces a value.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,400
Here's an example of an expression.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you think is the value of this expression?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Well here we have this string,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,300
We're multiplying this by 3.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,400
So the result will be a string of three asterisks like this.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Here's another question.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
What is a syntax error?

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
A syntax error is a kind of error that is due to bad syntax

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,200
or bad grammar in the code. and finally the last question.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,900
What does a linter do?

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,900
A linter is a tool that checks our code for potential errors

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,300
mostly in the category of syntactical Errors.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
So if you have grammatical issues in our code, the linter

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
will tell us before running a program.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,100
Okay, that's it for now.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,800
