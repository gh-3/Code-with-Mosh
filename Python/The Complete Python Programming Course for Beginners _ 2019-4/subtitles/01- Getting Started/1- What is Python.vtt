00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this course, you're going to learn everything you need

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to get started with Python. Just be aware that I've designed this course for

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
beginners, so if you have some programming experience, check out my other Python

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
course for developers. You can see the link on the top right hand corner of this

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
video. So, Python is the world's fastest

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
growing and most popular programming language not just amongst

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
software developers, but also amongst mathematicians

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
data analysts, scientists, accountants,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
network engineers and even kids. In fact it's the ideal programming

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
language to learn first. But what makes Python so special?

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here are 6 reasons. With Python you can solve complex

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
problems in less time with fewer lines of code then

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
many other languages. That's why huge companies like Google

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Spotify, Dropbox, and Facebook have embraced

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
this beautiful and powerful language. Here's an example.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's say we want to extract the first three characters of the

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
text hello world. This is the code you would have to write in C Sharp

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
this is how I would do this in JavaScript and here's how

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we would do it in Python. See how clean and simple it

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is? And that's just the beginning. Python is a multipurpose

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
language and you can use it for a wide range of jobs such as

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
data analysis. AI/ML writing automation

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
scripts. Building web, mobile, and desktop applications,

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
as well as software testing or even hacking. So if you want a

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
high paying long lasting career in all these areas,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
especially AI and mission learning. Python is the language

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to put those opportunities at your finger tips. In fact

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
according to Indeed.com the average salary of a Python

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
developer in the US was over $115,000

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in March 2018. And here are four more

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
reasons to make Pythons the most desirable language. Python

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is a high level language so you don't have to worry about complex

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
tasks such as memory management as you do in C++.

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's cross platform, which means you can build and run Python apps

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
on Windows, Mac, and Linux, it has a huge

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
community, so whenever you get stuck there is someone out there to help.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And, it has a large ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
tools. Whatever you want to do, it is likely that someone else

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
done it before. Because Python has been around for over 20 years.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
There are two versions of Python out there. Python

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
2 which is the legacy version of Python. And is going to be supported

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
until year 2020. And Python 3 which is Python

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
for the future. In this course you're going to learn Python 3.

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
