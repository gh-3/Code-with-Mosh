1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,600
So this environment you see here is what we call python interpreter,

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,900
which is basically a program that executes python code.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,800
We can type our python code in a file and give it to this

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,500
interpreter or we can type our code directly here in this

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,700
interactive shell.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,500
So here we can write an expression like two plus two in programming

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,700
and expression is a piece of code that produces a value so

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,700
here when we What's two plus two we get a value that is why

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,300
we refer to this piece of code as an expression.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,800
So enter we get for let's try a different kind of expression.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Let's see if 2 is greater than 1 we get true, which is an

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,000
example of a Boolean value.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,500
You're going to learn about this Boolean values in the next

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,900
section. Now, what if we type 2 is greater than 5 enter we

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,600
get false.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,300
So in programming we have true and false.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,600
False which are similar to yes, and no in English.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,900
Now what if we type 2 is greater than what we don't add a

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,000
second value here.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Just press enter.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,900
We got a syntax error in programming syntax means grammar.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,500
So just like we have the concept of grammar in the languages

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,300
that we speak.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,500
We have the exact same concept in programming if we write

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,900
a sentence that is not grammatically correct chances are

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,300
some people may not understand that sentence.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
So in this example, we have this expression, which is incomplete.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
It doesn't have the right grammar or syntax.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,300
That is why python interpreter is complaining by returning.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,900
An error.

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,800
So this interactive shell is a great way to quickly experiment

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,100
with a bit of python code, but that's not how we build real

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,800
world applications to do that.

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
We need a code editor and that's what I'm going to show you

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
in the next lecture.
