00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to convert vs code to a powerful

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
IDE by using an extension called python.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
With this extension or plug in we get a number of features such as

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
linting which basically means analyzing our code for potential

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
errors. We also get debugging which involves

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
finding and fixing errors. We look at this layer in the course. We also

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
get autocompletion which basically helps us write code faster so

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we don't have to type every character, we get code formatting which is

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
all about making our code clean and readable just like how we

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
format our articles, newspapers, books to make them clean

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and readable. We get unit testing which involves writing a bunch of

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
tests for our code, we can run these tests in an automated

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
fashion to make sure our code is behaving correctly. And finally

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we get code snippets, which are reusable code

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
blocks that we can quickly generate so we don't need to type them all by hand.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now don't worry about memorizing any of these, as we go through the course you're going to learn

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
about these features. Now here in vs code on the left side

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
click this icon, this opens the extensions tab.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So these are the extensions that we can install in vs code to

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
bring in additional functionality. Here under the recommended tab you

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
can see the python extension, if you don't see this

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
simply type python here on the top and

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
here's the extension so go ahead and install this,

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then you will have to reload vs code.

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now here on the bottom right hand corner we can see this

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
message, linter pylint is not installed.

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So as I told you before, linting is about finding potential errors in our code

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
linter is a program or a tool that analyzes

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
our code and finds these potential problems. Now for python,

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
there are several linters out there. Pylint is one of the most popular ones,

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that this python extension uses by default. So we need to

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
go ahead and install pylint as well. Now to do this

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
first we need to change our python environment. So if you look here on the

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
bottom left corner you can see the current python that is used in vs code.

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That is python 2.6.9 on my machine.

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Chances are you see a different version here, so click here,

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and in this list make sure to select python

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
3.7. So these changes are python

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
environment to python 3.7 and then we can install.

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Pylint by clicking this button

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
okay pylint is installed, in the next lecture I will show

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you how linting works.
