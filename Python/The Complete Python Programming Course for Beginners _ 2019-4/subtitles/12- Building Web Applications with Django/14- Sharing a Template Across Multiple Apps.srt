2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
In this lecture you're going to learn 
how to share a base template across multiple apps.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,340
So currently. in our movies app.
 we have this base template. We

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,060
want to take this out of this
 app and put it somewhere central. So

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,600
let's collapse this full there and create a

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,550
new folder in the root.
 We're going to call that templates. Now

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,160
let's go to the movies app
 and get this base template and

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,980
move it into the
 new templates folder. So drag

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,750
and drop move Beautiful. Now

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,140
let's go to the index
 template of the movies App. Currently

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,580
. we're referencing the base template
 in the movies app. but this template

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,060
is no longer there. So let's remove the

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,800
prefix or name space. Save the changes back

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,370
in the browser.
 Let's see what we get. So

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,370
Django cannot find this
 based on HTML template. And

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,920
if you scroll up. you can see
 the paths that jangle search for to

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,400
find this template. As you can
 see in this list. Jenko by

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,110
default only looks inside the installed apps

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,910
. So currently. the installed
 apps that have templates are admin

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,410
. auth and movies. But this templates folder

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,550
that we just created doesn't belong
 to any apps. So we need

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,580
to tell Django to search in
 this folder as well. So let's

23
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,130
open up our settings file
 that is inside the widely app

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,500
. Or we can press command
 on P on Mac or control P

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,120
on windows and search for settings pie. Now

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,440
. in this file. somewhere we have the

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,580
templates settings. There you go. So look at

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,190
these properties. The back end
 is set to jangle the

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,150
template that back ends the jangle jangle templates

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,470
. So this is the engine
 that comes with jangle that processes are

31
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,020
template files. This is the engine
 that is aware of those double curly

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,990
brace syntax or the template tax. Okay. Now

33
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,230
. the second property here
 is the directories that Django should

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,560
look for to find templates.
 This is set to an empty list

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,670
by default. So we'll have to
 add our new templates folder here. Below

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,940
that. we have up directory set to true.
 And this is telling

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,400
Django to search in the
 templates folder of the installed apps

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,970
. And finally we
 have this context processors. So

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,460
by default we have
 four context processors. The first

40
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,080
one debug adds debugging information to the context

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,850
object that is passed from
 the view to the template. The

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,130
second processor. It's called Request and this adds

43
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,250
the request object to our
 context so we can access it

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,730
in our templates. Similarly. we have another context

45
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,960
processor us. and this is
 used to bring information about the

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,100
current user in our templates.
 And finally we have messages and

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,400
this is used in scenarios where
 the user creates a new movie and

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
we want to display a message like
 the new movie was created successfully. So

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,920
back to the business Here.
 here. we need to add our new templates

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,730
folder. So this is the
 code that money too. right. We

51
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,880
need to go in the OS module.
 From there we go to the

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,560
path module. Here we have
 a function Join for joining

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,030
multiple paths. We want
 to get the base directory

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
of this application. This is
 a known predefined variable in

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,320
Django applications. Now we
 want to join this with

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,740
the templates folder that we just created. Save

57
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,540
the changes. So with
 this jangle will start searching

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,770
here. and if it can't find a template.
 then it will look at the

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,270
installed applications. So back in the browser. Let's

60
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:48,000
refresh. 
There you go.
Now we have a base template that 
we can share across multiple applications.
