2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,660
In this lecture we're going to add
bootstrap to our vidly application. 
In case

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,500
you're not familiar with Bootstrap,
it's basically a very popular CSS

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,440
framework that gives our applications a
modern look and feel. 
It's responsive

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,830
and mobile friendly right out of the box.
So we don't have to do any extra

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,460
work. 
So head over to get bootstrap dot com,

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,470
then go to the documentation page.
 Here we can find

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,110
the instructions to add boots
 draft to an existing website. So

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,430
basically. we have to add a CSS file.
 And here's the U

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,950
R L of debt CSS file in the cloud.
 You can also download it

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,360
and add it as a static
 file in your project. We should also

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,960
load a bunch of
 JavaScript files now. below that

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,650
. you can see the starter template.
 So let's copy this

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,850
template. Now back in our project in

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,370
the templates folder of our movies App.
 Inside the Movies folder

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,160
. Let's add and you file.
 We're going to call that base that

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,960
HTML. So this is the basic template

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,150
for all the pages in our movies.
 App. Let's face the

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,610
start. a template that
 was just copied. Okay. now

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,680
here on the top.
 Let's change the title to widely and

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,060
in the body section.
 Let's remove this H one

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,580
. Instead. We want to define
 a placeholder for other templates. So

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,210
when we render the list of movies.
 that template is going to return an HTML

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,880
table. We want to render
 that HTML table right here. So

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,260
we need a placeholder for our
 views to render their templates in

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,530
. And then it's pretty easy to
 define here we can type block again

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,240
. This is one of the code
 snippets that is available when using Django HTML

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,060
as the language to edit this file.
 So let's press enter

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,300
now. Here we have multi curse or editing.
 So whatever we type comes after

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,810
block and end block. we're going
 to give this block and name

31
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,420
. Let's call it content.
 Now. press the escape button and

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,770
remove the second content here.
 We don't really need to

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,760
add that to end block tag.
 So this is our content area

34
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,000
. Save the changes. Now.
 let's go back to our index template. We

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,550
can open the fight here or let
 me show you a short cut. If

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,080
you're on Mac press command on P.
 if you're on Windows Press

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,500
Control and P here. We can easily find

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,040
the files in our project.
 So let's search for index at

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,920
HTML. There you go.
 Now on the top. we

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,610
need to use another
 template tag called Extent. So

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,470
we jangle html selected as
 the language for this file. Let's

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,900
type extends press enter.
 What is the template that

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,060
we're extending that is based that html No

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,890
. Where should we put this table.
 We should put it in the content block that

45
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,090
was just defined. So one more
 time We use the block template

46
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,940
tag. As you can see again.
 we have multiple cursors activated

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,780
. Suppress the escape button
 a couple of times. Now

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,140
you have only a single cursor.
 So let's type content

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,390
. That's the name of our block.
 Now we need to move our table in

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,850
between the block tax.
 so I'm going to select this line

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,430
and press Ault and
 down Arrow to move it

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,800
down like this. There you

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,350
go. Now let's also invent this table tag

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,280
that is better. Save the
 changes back in the browser. Let's

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,910
refresh this page. We've got
 a template load error because Django

56
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,390
cannot find are based
 at the html template Once

57
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,980
again. look. here are the path
 it's searching for. so it's looking for

58
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,830
admin slash templates slash base html. Similarly

59
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,090
. we have another path for
 us app and one for the

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,580
movies. App Now look at the past
 that is used for the movies app that

61
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,320
is. Movies slash templates slash base that HTML

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,620
. But as I told you as
 a best practice. we should name space or

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,220
templates. So in this case.
 it's based on HTML doesn't

64
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,920
really exist in this folder.
 It's under the movies folder

65
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,890
inside the Templates folder. So to

66
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,150
fix this problem. we need to go
 back on the top and use our name

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,540
space. that is. Movies slash save the

68
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,060
changes back here. Refresh. 
The problem is gone. 
and our page looks a littlebit better.
