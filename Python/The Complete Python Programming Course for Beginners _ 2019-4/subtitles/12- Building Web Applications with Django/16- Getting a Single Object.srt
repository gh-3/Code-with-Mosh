2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,760
So here's our detailed view function and
this function we get the movie

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,290
id. 
So we can use our movie model to

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,600
get the movie with the given id.
It's a movie.objects earlier

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,580
you saw that all methods for getting
 all the movies from the database. We

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,050
also have another method
 for getting a single movie

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,420
. I hear we pass a
 keyword argument like I d equals movie

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,230
i D. We also have
 a known keyword PK. which

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,660
is short for primary key. You can
 use either I d or P. K

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,750
So we get a movie
 with this I d. Now

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,950
we need to put this in a template.
 render it and return the result. So

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,260
here we return rent there
 we pass a request object

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,980
. Then I'm more template is
 going to be movies slash detail dot

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,370
html See the convention I'm following.
 so I'm naming my templates based

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,350
on their view functions. Okay. So back

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,680
here finally we need to pass our context object.
 which is a dictionary here

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,950
. We're gonna have a key called movie.
 and we set it to this

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,760
movie object. Save the changes. Beautiful

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,410
. Now let's create our template.
 So in the

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,420
template for their Inside the Movies folder.
 Let's add and

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,870
your file detail dot html in

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,330
a stand plate on the top.
 First. we need to extend the

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,610
base html template. Then we

24
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,960
need to define a block. So block the

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,210
blocks were going to use
 is the content block. So here

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,190
I'm going to press the escape button
 a couple of times to disable multi

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,970
cursor editing and type content. Now

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,860
. in this block. I want
 to render a description list tag so

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,440
temporarily I want to change
 the language of this file from

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,570
django dot html to HTML.
 You also have a

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,200
shortcut for that. So you
 can press shift command and

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,260
pee on Mac or shift
 control p on windows here

33
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,400
type language and the
 first item is change language

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,950
. Mod enter.
 Let's change this to HTML. Okay

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,270
. Now. when we change the language to HTML.
 you can see we don't get this syntax

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,110
highlighting. So these tags are not recognized Now

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,420
they want to create a d l tag.
 Inside this tag. we

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,560
want to create a d.
 T. And next to that. we

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,100
want to have a d.
 D. So in this case. DL is

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,860
short for description list.
 In the description list. we have one

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,240
or more pairs of DT and DD.
 which are short

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,830
for term and description.
 Now we want three of these

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,510
. so I'm going to
 wrap these in parenthesis. then

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,480
multiplied by three tab. Beautiful. So

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,240
the first term went out. Here is
 the title of the movie below that

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,690
will render the actual value.
 So double Curly braces movie

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,970
the title. The second term is genre. and

48
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,580
similarly. we're going to
 define it here. Movie. that

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,460
genre. And finally. let's add Stark so

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,910
movie that number and stuck save

51
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,140
the changes are formatting
 is completely messed up. So

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,400
let's change the language back to
 jangle html one more time. Change

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,450
language to jangle html. Now

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,190
I have to manually fix this formatting like

55
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,350
this. Okay. Yeah. Now let's test our

56
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,800
new view. So back in the browser.
 let's refresh this

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,090
page. And here's how a description list is

58
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,000
rendered because also. add this
 in a table that's a matter of personal preference
