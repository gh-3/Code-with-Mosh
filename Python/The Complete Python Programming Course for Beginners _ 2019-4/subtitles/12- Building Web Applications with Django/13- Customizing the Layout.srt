2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,330
Now let's take this page to the next level.
 Let me show you how to add a

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,690
bootstrap navigation bar on the top. So and

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,050
bootstrap documentation on the left side.
 Look at components. Here

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,510
. We have various components.
 like alert badges and so on. In

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,350
this list. you can find nav bar. Okay

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,580
. And on this page you can
 see various examples of a bootstrap navigation

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,460
bar so we can have a
 navigation bar with drop down lists. If

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,020
you scroll down. you can
 see a very simple navigation

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,280
bar called Brandt. And below that.
 you can see the

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,840
HTML markup to render
 this navigation more. So let's

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,010
copy this Now back to our based on

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,500
HTML right after the body tag. Let's

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,380
paste this navigation bar and

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,770
then change nav bar too quickly. Save

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,500
the changes back here. Let's refresh. So

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,080
here's our navigation bar. That is better.
 Now this table is currently taking

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,450
the entire width of the page.
 Let's make it center. So

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,080
back to based on html.
 we should wrap this content

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,620
block inside of a main
 element with the container class

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,980
. So. in bootstrap.
 you want to create a main

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,500
tag with the class container. And

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,820
then we want to
 put this block inside of

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,720
the main task. Save the changes back

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,000
in the browser. Refresh.
 There you go. That is better. Also

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,420
let's add the vertical borders to this table. 
So back

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,000
to our template index at HTML.
 Here's our table. Let's

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,860
add another class table. dash bordered

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,230
. save back in
 the browser refresh. So that

30
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,950
looks better. Also.
 I'm going to add another class

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,100
table. dash. hover. And with this we

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,460
get Let's refresh.
 We get this nice effect here

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,790
. so our application looks better now.
 But there is a problem. This base

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,780
template that we defined that
 contains this navigation bar exists in

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,490
the movies. App. What if we had
 several other apps in this project. We

36
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,330
don't want to redefine this bootstrap
 template in every single app. So

37
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,000
in the next lecture. I will show
 you how to share a base template across multiple apps.
