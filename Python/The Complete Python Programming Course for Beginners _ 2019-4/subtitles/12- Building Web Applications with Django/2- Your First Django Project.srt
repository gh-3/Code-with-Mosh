2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,620
In this lecture you're going to learn
how to install Django and create your

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,350
first Django project. 
So here on the command line or terminal

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,290
let's create a new directory called vidly, that

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,510
is the name of our imaginary video rental application. Okay.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,110
Now let's go in this directory and 
install Django using

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,170
pipenv. 
So pipenv install django

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,700
and let's set the version to 2.1, 
to make sure we're

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,250
using the exact same version.
So there are no surprises later on

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,660
as you go through the videos.
Okay. let's go ahead. Beautiful.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,490
Now we need to activate our virtual environment. 
That is pretty easy.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,440
So pipenv shell. Okay.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,420
As you can see, the virtual environment 
for this project is activated.

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,180
Beautiful. 
So next we're going to use 
a tool called Django Admin

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,720
for creating a new Django project. So let's

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,650
run django-admin startproject.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,090
I'm going to call this project vidly, and

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,210
we want to create it in the current directory. 
So let's add a

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,810
period at the end.
When we run this command, django

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,380
admin is going to create a
basic website with some boilerplate code.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,870
You're going to see that in a second.
So let's go ahead. Beautiful.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,360
Now let's open this in VSCode. 
So code period.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,560
All right. 
Here's what we got.
Django Admin created this vidly

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,820
directory as well as this
manage.py file. 
We

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,440
use this manage.py
to perform some administrative tasks, such

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,900
as starting our web server, or 
migrating our database, 
populating

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,790
it with data and so on. 
You're going to learn about these as we go through

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,390
these tutorials. 
Now what is this vidly directory and why

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,780
do we have two vidly directories, the outer one and

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,350
the inner one? 
Well the other one is the one that we created and

31
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,520
that's the container for this project.
The inner one is simply a

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,690
package that is essentially the core of our project. 
It has a 

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,400
bunch of settings and
that's where everything gets started. 
So

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,660
what do we have here?
We have __init__.py. 
We have

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,850
seen this before. 
This tells Python to treat this directory as

36
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,420
a package. 
Below that we have settings up I

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,260
and in this file we have 
various configuration settings for our project. Next

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,500
we have urls and this is 
where we define various urln points

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,000
for our application.
And finally we have wsgi

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
which is short for 
Web server Gateway interface. The

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,970
purpose of this file is
to represent a standard interface between

42
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,150
applications written in python and Web servers. 
That is

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,340
an advanced topic and goes beyond
the scope of this tutorial. 
So for

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,880
now don't worry about it. 
Now we're going to use this manage.py to

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,500
start our development Web server.
So open up manage.py.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,650
Now with our python code open In VSCode,

47
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,410
we can select our Python interpreter.
So click this python on

48
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,280
the status bar. 
This is the Python interpreter that is installed globally.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,830
We need to change this to the Python interpreter installed in

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,440
our virtual environment that is this one here. We

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,980
get this familiar message:
Linter pylint is not installed. 
So

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,360
let's go ahead and install that. 
All

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,650
right. 
Now in this terminal window with 
vidly Virtual environment activated,

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,000
let's run python or python3 manage.py runserver. Now

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,060
by default this is going to
start a development server on Port 8000.

57
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,550
If you have an application that
is already listening on that port, you

58
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,940
can specify a different port number here.
In this tutorial, I'm

59
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,270
going to go with the standard port.
so let's run this. Okay.

60
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,290
You get this warning:
you have 15 unapplied migration(s).

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,420
Don't worry about that. 
We're going to get to that shortly. 
So as you can

62
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,070
see, we have a web server 
listening at this address and

63
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,510
we can stop it at any
time by pressing control z. 
So

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,950
now let's navigate to this address.
All right. 
Here's

65
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,680
our first Django project. Beautiful. 
Over the next few lectures we're

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,000
going to modify this application bit by bit and 
implement our imaginary video rental application.
