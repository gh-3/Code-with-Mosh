2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,070
So our application is working out to this point.
 But what if I pass an

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,070
invalid movie idea here. Let's say 10 we

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,370
get an exception of
 type does not exist. That

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,210
is not good. So the common
 pattern to handle these situations is

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,170
to return an http 404 error. 404

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,460
is the standard http error
 that says the page or the

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,280
resource we're looking for
 does not exist. So to

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,650
fix this problem. we need
 to handle this exception and return

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,110
an http 404 error. So we wrap this

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,890
and a try block and
 then catch the exception. So

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,310
here we accept.
 The exception is of type does

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,510
not exist. and this
 exception class is part of

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,260
our model. So movie dot

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,740
does not exist.
 Let's have a quick look at

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,290
this class one more time.
 so I'm going to go in the models

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,670
module. 
Here's our movie class.
We derive this from the model

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,340
class in Django.
 This Model class defines this exception,

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,820
DoesNotExist, and that
 is why it's inherited in

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,660
our movie class as well as
 any other models in our project. So

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,320
we handle this exception. and here will

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,710
return a 404 error.
 So on the top from

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,220
django dot http module.
 we need to import http four

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,340
or four class now
 back to our view of

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,720
function. When we catch this exception. we

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,970
should raise the HDD before of our exception. So

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,160
instead of returning.
 we're going to raise http four

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,360
or four because this is an exception
 class that we need to raise. So

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,060
save the changes. 
Back in the browser. 
Let's

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,540
pass an invalid movie idea here.
 and we get a

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,080
page not found with a status code 404. 
Now

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,420
back to view function. 
Every time we have to get a single object and render

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,250
it, we'll have to follow this pattern.
We have to add this try statement,

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,570
get the movie,
render it and 
then catch an

35
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,890
exception of type DoesNotExist and 
then raise an

36
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,790
Http404 exception. 
In a real application where

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,460
you have a lot of view functions
 like this detailed view function. this pattern

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,810
ends up being so repetitive.
 So that's why we have a shortcut for

39
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,140
that in Django. Because.
 as I told you before. Django is

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,730
focused on productivity so
 we can build applications with

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,050
less code. So on the top. Here we

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,560
have this module. Django. that shortcut from

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,430
this module. Let's import get object or

44
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,910
four or four. This is a function.
 This function implements

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,200
this pattern so we don't have to
 repeat it in every view function. So

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,650
now we can simplify this
 view function like this. We

47
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,170
remove. try and accept

48
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,420
statements. Now. instead of getting

49
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,990
a single object using the get method.
 we're going to use the shortcut

50
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,930
function. That was just important. So but

51
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,670
still it is recall. Get object or

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,090
four or four. We passed the primary key.
 and this function will

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,600
automatically raise a four or four exception.
 If this movie doesn't

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,210
exist now. save the changes back

55
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,420
in the browser refresh. 
Oops. I missed the

56
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,030
first argument. 
So here this function should know

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,570
what kind of model to work with.
So earlier we used the

58
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,240
Movie class, the Movie model,
but currently when calling this function

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,580
we haven't specified this model.
So this function doesn't know

60
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,820
what model it should query.
So as the first argument we need to

61
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,850
pass our model class. that is movie. Okay

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Now save the changes and 
refresh this one more time, 
now we get a Page not found error
