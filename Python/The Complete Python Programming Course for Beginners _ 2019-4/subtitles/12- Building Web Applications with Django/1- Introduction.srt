00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,320
in this

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,750
section you're going to learn how to
 build a simple Web application using a

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,390
super popular Web framework called Django. I

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,010
love their tagline,
The Web framework for perfectionists with

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,540
deadlines. 
And that's absolutely true.
 If you're a perfectionist and

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,610
want to build a real enterprise
 Web application that is fast, secure,

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,960
and scalable, Jangle is your best friend. 
Here's

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,270
some of the popular websites that
 are built with Django like Instagram. Spotify

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,850
. YouTube. Washington Post.
 Dropbox and so on. So

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,530
in this section we're going to use
 Jango to build a simple imaginary video

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,820
rental application called lately. So here

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,150
we have a list of movies.
 Each movie has properties like

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,640
title genre. number in stock and daily rental

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,350
rate. We can click on
 each movie to see more details

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,610
Now I know this is not 
a fascinating looking application because our

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,120
focus in this section is not
 to build a full featured application that

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,230
looks fancy. 
We just want to learn how jangle works. 
So I'm

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,950
gonna walk you through the process
of building applications with Django. 
So

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,540
in this application we have these two pages. 
We also have

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,360
an API that is available at api/movies.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,330
So this API returns the list of our movies as JSON. 
Now

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,570
if you're not familiar with APIs, don't worry 
you're gonna learn everything from

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,420
scratch. 
So in this section will build this application and

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,360
more importantly deploy it to
 a cloud platform called Harajuku.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,410
So you will see the process of 
building a simplified web application from

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,150
A to Z. 
Are you excited? 
I hope you are. 
And let's

27
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,540
get started.
