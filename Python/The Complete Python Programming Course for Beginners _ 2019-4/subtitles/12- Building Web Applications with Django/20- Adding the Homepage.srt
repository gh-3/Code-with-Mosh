2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,140
All right. 
So we have done so much in this half.
We have created our movies page,

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,260
we added navigation, 
here we can see the details about the

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,790
movie, 
we also published an api. 
However our

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,470
homepage is broken. 
So if we head over here, we

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,400
got a page not found.
So at the beginning of this section, just

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
after we created our Django project,
 we had a beautiful homepage here.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,880
What happened to that?
Well Django displays that automatically

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,840
until we register a newurl pattern. 
So

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,400
here in our main urls module
initially we only had this

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,650
admin url pattern. 
The moment we register a

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,460
new url pattern,
Django stops displaying that default homepage.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,760
And the HTML for that homepage 
is not stored anywhere in this project. 
So

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,940
we need to manually create a new homepage.
And that's pretty easy. 
Let me

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,030
show you. 
So here in our vidly folder, let's

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,760
add a new file, views dot

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,080
py. 
In this module we're going to define a view

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,040
function called home that takes a request. 
And

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,460
here we simply render a template and 
return it. 
So on

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,570
the top first from django.shortcuts we

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,770
need to import the render function. 
And then

22
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,450
here we return render. 
As the first argument

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,580
we'll pass our request then as a

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,720
template we pass home.html. 
And here we

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,230
don't need to pass a context object
 because we're not going to display any

26
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,790
data on our homepage. 
So delete. 
Now

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,530
we need to map this view function
to a url endpoint. 
So

28
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,330
back to urls module.
First we need to import our

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,260
views module. 
So from the current folder,
let's import views.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,170
Next we add a new url pattern. 
So path. 
We

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,620
pass an empty string to represent the homepage. 
We map this 

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,660
to views.home. Okay. 
Now

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,170
finally we need to create the template. 
Here we have two options: One 

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,680
option is to add the templates folder 
in this vidly folder, 

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,960
just like how we added templates to our movies app. 
But if you 

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,220
do so, we should also register
 this folder as an app in

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,860
settings.py because by
default this is not registered as

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,060
an app. 
It kind of looks like an app, 
but it's not an app. 
So if

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,600
you look at settings.py, 
here in the list of installed apps 

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,280
we don't have an  app that represents vidly. 
So

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,750
if you want to register this as an app, 
we need to add a configuration class 

42
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,010
just like the movies and api apps.
So we need to add a

43
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,210
file called apps.py and 
in that file we need to create a

44
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,630
class called VidlyConfig. 
After we installed the

45
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,110
vidly app, Django will be
 able to find the templates in

46
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,590
this app. Okay?
So this is one option.
The other option is

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,520
to put all this general templates 
like home page, about page,

48
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,900
contact page and similar pages inside the

49
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,300
main templates folder in this project. 
The

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,540
approach you choose It's more of a personal preference. 
I personally have

51
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,710
tried both and 
sometimes I go back and forth between these two

52
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,090
approaches. 
But there's really no practical differences between

53
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,660
these two approaches. 
Yes, we can sit down and argue for one hour about

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,140
the differences between these approaches 
at a theoretical level, but

55
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,410
in practice these arguments are useless.
So to keep things

56
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,250
simple, I'm going to add ourhome template 
in the main templates folder.

57
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,950
So new file home.html. 
Now

58
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,290
here first we need to extend our base dot

59
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,560
HTML template. 
Then we need to define a block called

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,760
content. 
And in this

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,160
block I simply want to add
 a link to our movies app.

62
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,480
So let's add an anchor with

63
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,820
href set to and 
here we're going to use the

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,070
url template tag. 
So url, enter. 
What is

65
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,790
the url that we want to render? 
Well that is movies

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,440
colon index. 
So once again we're referencing

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,450
a url by its name.
Save the changes. 
And

68
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,680
it's better to a indent this to make it cleaner. 
And one last

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,460
thing before we test the result,
let's add a label here Movies.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Now save the changes.
Back in the browser. 
So

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,580
here's our new homepage. 
I know it doesn't look fascinating, 
but it 

72
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:27,000
gets the job done. 
So we can navigate to the movies page and 
see the list of movies.
