00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,580
In this lecture we're going to look at
 a few useful functions to work with

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,360
numbers. So we have
 this built in function round

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,020
for rounding a number.
 So if you pass 2.9 here

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,960
and print the result. we'll get three

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,990
. We have another useful
 built in function called A

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,900
B s. which returns the
 absolute value of a number. So

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,880
if you past negative 2.9 here.
 we'll get positive

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,460
2.9. Technically. we have only a handful of

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,550
built in functions to
 work with numbers. If you

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,420
want to write a program that 
involves complex mathematical

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,480
calculations you need to
 use the math module. A

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,110
module is like a separate
 file with some python code. So,

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,660
in python we have this 
math module which includes lots

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,060
of mathematical functions for working with numbers. But

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,720
we need to import this module
 so we can use it. on

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,080
the top, We type import math. Now

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,650
math in this
 program is an object so

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,030
we can use the dot notation to see

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,630
all the functions or
 more accurately all the methods

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,120
available in this object. As an example we

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,360
have math dot ceil for getting the

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,960
ceiling of a number.
 So if you pass 2.2 here

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,360
and run this program. we get

25
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,580
three. Now in this math module we

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,260
have lots of functions. Let me show
 you how to find the complete list.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,830
Here on Google
 search for python 3. Make

28
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,260
sure to add the version number. math module.

29
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,150
On this page
 you can see all the

30
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,490
functions in the math module.
 So in this lecture we looked

31
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,000
at math.ceil. We also have 

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,220
math.copysign, fabs
 and so on. As an

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,420
exercise I encourage you to play
 with a couple of functions in this module.
