00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,480
We're goinna start this section

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,120
by exploring comparison operators. we use
comparison operators to compare values.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,560
Here are a few examples.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,280
So 10 is greater than three.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
We get true.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,960
So what we have here is a boolean 
expression,

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,160
because when this expression is evaluated,
we'll get a boolean value 

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,040
that is True or False.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,400
Here's another example.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,560
Ten is greater than or equal to three.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,880
Once again, we get true.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,720
We also have less than 10 is less than 20.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,480
We have less than or equal to.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
Here's the equality operator.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,920
So 10 is equal to 10.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,600
What about this expression?

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,360
What do you think we're gonna get?

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,000
We get False, because these values have

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,200
different types and they're stored
differently in the computer's memory.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,640
And finally, we have
the not equal operator.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
So now with this expression,
we should get True, beautiful.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,520
We can also use this comparison
operators with strings.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,960
Let me show you so we can check
to see if bag is greater than Apple.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,800
We get True because when we sort 
these two words back comes after, 

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,680
So it's considered greater. 

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,560
Now, what about this one
bag equals capital back.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,120
Yet false, here is the reason:

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,760
every character you see here has
a numeric representation in programing.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
Let me show you.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,280
So we have this built
in function called ord.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,520
Don't worry about memorizing this because

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,840
you're probably never gonna
use this in the future.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,920
But let me show you the numeric
representation of the letter b.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,560
So that is 98, in contrast,
Capital B is represented as six to six,

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,040
that is the reason these
two strings are not equal.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,640
So these are the comparison
operators in Python.

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,960
Next, we'll look
at conditional statements.
