1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,970
All right. here's a little quiz for

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,180
you. I want you to pause
 the video and think about this

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,480
quiz for 10 to 20 seconds.
 What do you think we'll

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,850
see on the terminal when
 we run this program. So

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,100
pause the video. Figure out the
 answer when you're ready. Come back

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,700
. Continue watching. All

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,120
right. Let's see what happens
 when we run this program. First

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,400
we get this. If statement
 in this case. we're comparing two

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,140
different objects for equality.
 And these objects have different types

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,600
. We have a number
 compared with the strength. So

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,070
number 10 and strengthen are not equal.
 That is why

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,780
they will not be printed
 on the terminal. So the control

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,750
moves the L F part here we have two

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,000
billion expressions. Here is
 the first one. Here's the

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,690
second one and they
 are combined using the logical

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,230
end. So if both
 these expressions are evaluated to

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,370
true. then this intern expression will be

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,810
true and we will see
 beyond the terminal. Let's see

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,180
if both these expressions
 are evaluated to true. Here's

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,780
the first part.
 Bag is greater than Apple. That

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,660
is true because when we
 sort these words. bag comes

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,180
after apple. But look
 at the second part. This

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,580
expression is evaluated to
 false because bag is not

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,040
greater than cat. So when
 we apply the logical end

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,180
between true and false. the result will be

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,480
false. That is why this statement will not

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,610
be executed. So to control
 moves to the else part. And

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,850
when we run this program.
 the letter C will be printed on
