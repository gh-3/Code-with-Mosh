00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,080
In this lecture, I'm gonna show you
a technique for writing cleaner code.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,080
So let's say we're building an application

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,920
for a university
and we wanna check to see if the person

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,400
who's applying for this university
program is eligible or not.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,800
So we start by defining
a variable called Age Sedita 22.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Now, if age is greater than or equal
to 18, Courland Prent eligible.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Remove the indentation else,
colon print, not eligible.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's run a program, make sure it works.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,320
Beautiful.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,640
Now, there is nothing wrong in this piece

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,200
of code, but I want to show you a cleaner
way to achieve the same result.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,040
Instead of having a print statement here,

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,600
we can define a variable like message
and set it to this string.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,480
That is the first step.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,440
So message equals this string
and then we will print this message.

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,560
Now, when you have and if else statement
with this structure where you're basically

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,320
assigning a value to a variable,
you can rewrite this in a simpler way.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
So this is how it works.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,000
All we want to do over these few lines is

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,800
to assign a value to this
message variable.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Right.
So we start with the message.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,200
We set it to eligible

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,960
if age is greater than or equal to 18
or else we set it to not eligible.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,240
This statement is almost like plain

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,440
English,
so what we have on line seven is exactly

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,840
equivalent to these four
lines of code delete.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,800
Save the changes round the program.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You can see this person is eligible.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,840
If I change the age to 12 and run
the program, we get not eligible.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,040
So what we have here is
called ternary operator.
