1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,420
mhm. Yeah. In

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,720
programming. we have this
 concept called Nested Loops so

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,940
we can put one loop
 inside of another loop. And with

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,850
this. we can get some interesting results.
 Let me show you. So

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm going to start with
 this loop for X in range

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,600
five. Colin. Now inside of

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,110
this loop. I'm going to
 add another loop. So for why

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,650
in range three. Colin And

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,820
then in our second loop.
 I'm going to add a print statement here

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,760
. We can use
 formatted strings to display coordinates

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,840
. Remember Formatted strings.
 So we have f followed by

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,970
quote. Now. here we add parenthesis for coordinate

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,420
. First we want to
 display X and then comma. followed

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,940
by Why. Let's run
 this program and see what

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,530
happens. There you go. Pretty cool. isn't

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,040
it. So we get zero
 and 00 and 10 and

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,800
two. Then we get one
 and 01 and 11 and two

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,700
and so on. Now let me explain.
 How exactly. Python

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,960
Interpreter. execute this code. So here we have

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,030
two loops. This is what
 we call the outer loop. And

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,870
this is the inner loop.
 So the execution of our program starts

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,960
here in the first iteration
 of this loop X zero

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,930
. Now we get to this
 statement which is a child of

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,790
this four statement because
 it's indented four times. This

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,110
statement itself is a loop. So what we

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,830
have inside of this
 loop will be executed three

27
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,490
times in the first situation. X is

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,060
zero because we're still in the
 first iteration of the outer loop

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,240
. And why is also zero.
 Because we're in the first iteration of

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,750
the inner loop. That is
 why we get zero and zero

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,360
. Now we go to the
 second iteration of this inner loop. In

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,660
this situation. why will
 be one whereas X is

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,360
still zero. That is why
 we get zero and one and

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,550
similarly in the third iteration of
 our inner loop will get zero

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,390
and two in the terminal.
 Now we're done with the execution of

36
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,880
the inner loop. So the
 control moves back to our outer

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,230
loop. Here will be in
 the second iteration. so X will

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,140
be one and then
 we start here again. So

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,680
we have to execute this
 inner loop three times in

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,140
the first situation. Why will
 be zero and X is

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,760
one. So here we have one on zero.
 Then we'll get one on one and

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,410
one and two. You got the point.
 So this is all about
