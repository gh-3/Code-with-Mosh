00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,630
mhm. continuing with

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,450
the example from the last lecture.
 Let's imagine the scenario where

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,330
. after the first attempt.
 we can successfully send the message. In

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,480
that case. we want to jump out
 of this loop. We don't want to

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,950
repeat this task of sending a message three

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,270
times. Let me show you
 how to implement this. So in

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,080
this demo. I'm going to simulate
 the scenario where we can successfully

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,660
send a message.
 So we define a variable successful

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,430
and set it to true.
 Now here. after this

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,860
print statement will have and if

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,030
statement if successful. colon then

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,690
perhaps we can print successful now

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,940
here. We want to jump out
 of this loop. For that. we use

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,210
the break statement. Let's find
 this program and see what

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,660
happens. So there you go. After the

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,010
first attempt. we are successful and there

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,290
are no more attempts.
 So once again. I want

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,540
you to pay great attention
 to the indentation here because that's

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,870
one of the common
 issues amongst beginners. So here's

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,440
our for loop.
 These two lines are indented with

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,190
four spaces. and they belong
 to our for loop in

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,940
every iteration. These two
 lines will be executed now

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,160
. when we get to line four.
 If this condition is true. then

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,040
these two lines will be executed.
 Because both these

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,660
lines are indented below this. If statement

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,490
Now let's take this program to
 the next level. What if we

27
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,730
attempt three times and we
 still cannot send an email. Perhaps

28
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,930
we want to display a different message
 to the user. We say. Hey. we

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,500
tried three times.
 but it didn't work. So I'm

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,680
going to change. Successful to false. Now

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,230
at the end here we
 can add an else statement. This

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,650
is what we call
 a for else statement. What

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,510
we put under this else
 statement will only be executed if

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,090
this loop completes without an early termination. So

35
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,350
if we never break out
 of this loop, then the

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,730
else statement will be executed.
 So here we can print a

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,360
message like attempt at three times and

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,050
failed. So run the program

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,400
. see what we get.
 Three attempts followed by this message attempted

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,250
three times and failed. In contrast. if

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,910
you change successful too
 true because we terminate this

42
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,450
loop using this break statement.
 What we have in

43
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,000
the else block will not be executed.
 Take a look. Run

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,560
the program. We have one attempt successful. done
