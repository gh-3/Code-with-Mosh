mhm and this

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,220
lecture. I'm going to show you
 how to change comparison operators. This

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,440
is a very powerful technique
 for writing clean code. Here's an

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,770
example. Let's say we want
 to implement a rule that

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,950
says age should be between 18 and 65

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,850
. Here's how we can implement it.
 So we define a variable like age

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,220
7 to 22. Now. if age is

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,840
greater than or equal
 to 18 and age is

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,260
less than 65 then we print eligible

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,920
. Now here's a question for you.
 How do we write this rule in math. We

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,070
can write it like this well

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,560
. more accurately. We should
 have an equal sign here. so

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,490
age should be between 18 and 65

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,660
. This is how we write
 this rule in math. Now I've got

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,280
some good news for you.
 We can write the exact same expression in

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,150
Python. so I'm going
 to move this up put

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,360
And if statement here Line four and

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,780
93 are exactly equivalent.
 But as you can see

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,420
. Line four is cleaner
 and easier to read. So let's

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,680
get rid of Line three. This is what
