1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,440
all right. Time for an exercise.
 I want you to write a

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
program to display the even numbers between 1

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,700
to 10. So when you run this program.
 you should see 2 4 6 and 8

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,000
and after these I want
 you to print this message: We

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,220
have 4 even numbers. Now,

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,450
here is a quick hint.
 Before you get started. you should call the

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,730
range function with 1 and 10.
 Do not use

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,020
the third argument which is called Step.
 So basically, I

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,170
want you to iterate over all the
 numbers between 1 to 10. Check

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,420
if each number is an
 even number and then print it on

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,730
the terminal. So pause the video. Spend two

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:50,400
minutes on this exercise. When you're done,
 come back Continue watching. So

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,280
we start with a four
 loop for number in range 1

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,640
to 10 colon. We check

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,920
to see if the remainder
 of division of this number by

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,550
two equals zero. So if number module

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,760
IHS two equals zero. then reprint

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,780
this number. Now let's

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,060
run this program. So we get 2468 Beautiful

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,880
. Now to count the even numbers.
 we need a separate

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,220
variable. So let's call that count. Initially. we

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,600
set it to zero Now in
 this if block. every time we

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,250
find an even number.
 we need to increment count

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,430
. So we said
 Count Plus equals one. And

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,190
finally. after our four loop.
 we can print a

26
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,470
formatted strength. We have count. even

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,400
numbers. Let's run the program. And

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,560
here's the result. So that brings
 us to the end of this

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,930
section. In the next section.
 you're going to learn how to create your

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,110
own functions. I hope you
 enjoy the section and thank you
