00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
In almost every program,
there are times you need to make

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,560
decisions, and that's when
you use an if statement.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,040
Here's an example.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,200
Let's say we have a variable
called temperature is 30 to 35.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,960
Now, if temperature is greater than 30,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
perhaps we want to display
a message to the user.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,640
So we use an if statement if

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,280
after if we add a condition,
which is basically a boolean expression,

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,520
an expression that produces
a boolean value.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,840
So if temperature is greater than 30,
here we have a Boolean expression.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
If this expression evaluates to True, the
following statements will be executed.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,840
Let me show you now, here's the important
part that a lot of beginners miss.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
When you use an if statement,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,280
you should always terminate
your statement with a colon.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Now, let's see what happens
when I press enter,

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,600
our cursor is in indented,
so here we have two white spaces.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,240
This is very important because using these

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,520
indentations, Python interpreter will
know what statements should be executed.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,600
If this condition is true here,
we want to print a message like

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,920
"it's warm".

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,560
We can print another message as well,

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,840
"Drink water". so we can have as
many statements as we want here

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
as long as there are indented,

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880
they belong to this if block.

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,400
Now, when we finish here,

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,080
we should remove indentation
to indicate the end of this if block.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,280
So here we can add a print statement
with a message like Don,

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,720
this statement will always be executed,
whether this condition is true or not.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
Now, note that when I saved the changes,

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,040
this indentation you see here
is going to be doubled up.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
Take a look. save, there you go.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
So when we save the changes auto pep8

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,000
reformats our code and uses
four white spaces for indentation.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
So one, two, three, four.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,200
It uses four white spaces because
that's what pep8 recommends.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,920
All right.
Now let's run this program.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,720
So because temperature is greater than 30,

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,720
we see the first two messages and we
see the darn message regardless.

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,080
So if I change the temperature to,
let's say, 15 and run the program one more

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,680
time, look, this Done message is executed
whether our condition is true or not.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,440
So pay great attention
to these indentations,

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
That's one of the issues
I see in beginner's code.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,960
Let's say they want both these
print statements to be executed.

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,360
If the condition is true accidentally,
they remove the indentation on the fourth

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,720
line and that's why their program
doesn't work as they expect.

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,320
So be careful about this.

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Now, what if you want to have multiple
conditions? we use an elif statement.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
So elif. That is short for else if.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,160
Here we can add another condition,
another expression.

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,160
So temperature is greater than 20.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,040
Once again, colon, enter now by default

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,520
here VSCode is using two white spaces.

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
So don't worry about this as soon as you

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,000
save the changes, those two white spaces
will be converted to four white spaces.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,680
So let's print a different message.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,040
It's nice.

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,680
Save the changes now, look,

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,320
all these lines are indented consistently.
You can have as many elif statements as

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,080
you want, and optionally you
can also have an else statement,

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,320
So if none of the previous conditions are

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,840
True, then what you have
in the else block will be executed.

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Once again, we had the colonannotation,
print.

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,440
Here we can add a message
like it's cold.

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
Save the changes.

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
In this case temperature is 15,
so none of these two conditions will be

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,600
True and we will see it's cold.
Let's run the program.

67
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,440
There you go.
