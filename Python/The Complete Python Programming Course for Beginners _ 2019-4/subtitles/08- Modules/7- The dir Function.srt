00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,390
In this lecture we're going to look at
a powerful built in function called dir. 
With

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,910
this function we can get the
 list of attributes and methods defined

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,660
in an object. 
So in this example
we're importing the sales module

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,470
as you learned earlier.
Now sales is an object, so we

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,890
can use the dot operator
 to access all the methods and

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,660
attributes defined in this object.
As you work on large projects 

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,070
there are times that things don't work as you expect, 
so you can use the dir 

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,080
function for debugging.
Let me show you. 
So let's

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,290
print dit of sales. 
When

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,820
we run this program, we get 
an array of strings in

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,570
this array. 
We have all the attributes and methods defined in

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,150
an object. 
So as you see in our sales module, we have these

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,880
two functions calculate shipping and tax as

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,430
well as these magic attributes
 that are automatically created for

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,960
us. 
Let's take a look at a few of these. 
so I'm

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,360
going to comment out this line and 
print sales dot

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,550
name, 
that returns the name of our module. 
We

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,500
can also get name of the package, 
as

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,800
well as the file name, as well as 
the address of its file. So

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,790
let's run this program. So here
 is the name of our module. As

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,570
you can see, 
it's fully qualified with the name of its packages. 
After

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,970
that we have the name of our package.
 So the sales module is

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,470
defined in ecommerce dot shopping package, 
and

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,950
below that we have the path to this file and file system
