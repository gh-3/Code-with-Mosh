00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,880
So here in app.py 
I'm currently importing the sales module. 
When

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,310
Python sees this, 
it will look for a file called sales dot

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,590
py in the current directory.
If it doesn't find

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,020
this file, 
it will look in a bunch of 
predefined directories that

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,640
come with python installation.
Let me show you. 
So

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,150
we have a built in module called path. 
Let's import that.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,440
In this module we have a variable path which 
returns

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,920
the list of directories that
 Python will look at to find a

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,320
module. 
Let's print this on the terminal. 
So

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,540
as you see, we get 
an array of strings. 
The

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,170
first element in this array
 represents the current folder, so

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,320
on my machine that is mashfeghhamedani slash

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,760
Dropbox Courses Python blah blah blah. 
On your machine

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,220
is going to be different.
 After that we have Library Frameworks

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,980
Python.framework Versions 3.7 da da da da da.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,440
This is going to be different 
on your machine depending on 
your operating system. 
I'm

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,170
using Mac, so this is
the address of python installation on

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,570
Mac OS. 
On Windows you're probably going to get something like

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,970
C drive Backslash program files Python.\ blah

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,720
blah blah. 
So when Python sees an import statement

22
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,110
it will search 
all this directories to find this module. 
As soon

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,570
as it finds the module,
the search stops there. 
Now

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,740
you might be curious 
How we can import a module from a subdirectory? 
Well

25
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,140
to do that we need to look at packages and 
that's the topic for the next lecture.
