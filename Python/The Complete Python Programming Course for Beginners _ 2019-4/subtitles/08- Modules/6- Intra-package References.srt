00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,180
There are times that you want to
import modules from sibling packages. 
For

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,340
example here in our ecommerce package
I have added a

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,520
new sub package customer in this package. we

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,960
have this contact module
for contacting our customers. 
Now

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,130
let's say in our sales module 
we want to use the 

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,310
contact module in the customer package.
Let me show you how

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,660
to do this.
So we open this. 
To import

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,320
a module from another package, 
we can use an absolute or 

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,410
relative import statement. 
So, here

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,680
is an absolute import: 
from our top level

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360
packages eccommerce, so we start there, then

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,540
we go to the customer sub package and 
now we import

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,900
the contact module. 
So this

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,310
contact object has a method
 we can use anywhere in

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,720
this module. 
So this is the absolute importance. 
We

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,760
can also use a relative import. 
So from

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,580
dot this represents the current package, 
dat dat

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,290
takes us one level up, 
so now we're at the ecommerce package

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,950
level. 
In this package we have two sub packages: 
customer and

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,650
shopping, so we can go to 
the customers sub package and

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,100
then import the contact module. 
As

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,570
a best practice prefer to use absolutely imports, and 
that's what pep

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,390
eight also recommends. 
But if your absolutely import gets really verbals

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,710
like a.b.c.d.e , then you

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,000
might be able to simplify the import statement 
by using a relative import.
