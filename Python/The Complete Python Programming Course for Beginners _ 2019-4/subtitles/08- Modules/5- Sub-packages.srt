00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,810
As your programs grown, 
you may want to 
break down a package into sub

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,090
packages. 
For example let's imagine our

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,620
ecommerce package has grown a lot.
We have so many files and modules

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,880
here. So we decided to break
 this package into a few sub

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,560
packages. 
So I'm going to
add a new folder here

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,880
call it shopping. 
And then move the

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,200
sales module in this folder. 
So

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,840
on the top we have the ecommerce package and 
under that we have

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,600
the shopping package. 
Now currently shopping is not a package because

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,300
in this folder we don't have 
the init file. 
So

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,950
let's add a new file double underscore init

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,490
double underscore dot py. 
Now

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,940
back to app dot py
Once again python cannot find our sales

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,230
module. 
So to fix this issue, we need to add the

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,360
name of our new sub package here.
so ecommerce dot shopping.
