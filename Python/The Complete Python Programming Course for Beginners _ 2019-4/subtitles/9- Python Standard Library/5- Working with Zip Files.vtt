00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture, you're going to learn how to work with zip files in python.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, from the zip file module. Let's import

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the zip file class, now we create a zip file object,

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
let's call that file, .zip, then as

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the second argument we pass, w, short for write, because we're going to

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
write to the zip file. So this statement will create this file,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in our current folder, let's get a reference to the zip file, and store it

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
here, or we could call it zip for shorter,

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
now let's say we want to get all the files in this ecommerce directory

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and write them to this zip file. That is pretty easy. So,

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we create a path object to reference the ecommerce directory

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and then call rglob method,

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to recursively find all the files

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in this directory and all is true. And as you know this returns a

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
generator, so we iterate over it, or path

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in. And then call zip.write.path.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And finally we should call closed

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
method. Now if something goes wrong here chances

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
are the statement may not be called, so we should either use a

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
try finally block, or the with statement which is shorter and cleaner.

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So, with the ZipFile,

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
has zip, now we indent everything here,

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we don't need to call the close method. Let's save the changes

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and run this program, now we have a zip file here,

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
files.zip, so let's go ahead and read its content. So back in app

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
.py. I'm going to comment out these few lines

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
this time we're going to create a zip file that is

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
files.zip but we're not going to open this in the write mode because we

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
only want to read from it. So this object has a

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
method called name list which returns the list of all

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the files in this zip file. So let's print this

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
list run the program, so

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
these are all the files, we have in the zip file. We can get information

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
about any of these files, for example let me copy this here

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
then all zip.getinfo

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and pass the address of this file. This

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
returns an info object, from this we can print

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
info.file underline size

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
we also have info.compress size.

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Let's look at the result. So in this case we

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
don't have compression because we're dealing with a really simple file.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now finally to extract all the files from the zip file,

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
we called  zip.extract all

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and optionally specify a different directory to extract to.

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So here let's extract this into this extract

46
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
directory, now here we have this

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
extract directory with the content of the ecommerce directory that we

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.500
compressed into a zip file.
