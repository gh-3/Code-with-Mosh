00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In the last lecture you learned about date time objects, these objects represent

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a point in time. In a date time module, we also have a

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
class called time delta, which represents a duration.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So let's import timedelta from here.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now when we subtract these two dates, you get a time delta object.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So let's set duration to dt2-dt1.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And print it on the terminal,

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so here is the difference between these two date times.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now this time delta object has a few interesting attributes, we have

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
duration.days let's print that on the terminal,

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then label for clarity, you also

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
have seconds let's take a look,

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and run the program, so we have

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
324 days, and 46000 seconds.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So this 46,000 represents this

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
value. 12 hours and 58 minutes is equivalent to

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
46000 seconds. We also have a method

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
called total seconds. This is a method

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
not an attribute. Let's see what this returns.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So this value you see here is the total

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
duration represented as seconds. So if you

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
calculate the number of seconds in 324 days and 4 hours

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and 59 minutes we get this value.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So these are a few interesting members of the time delta class.

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So in case you're wondering why we don't have month or year here,

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the reason is that we can have a varying amount of time in a month or in a year,

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that's why we only have days, seconds and microseconds.

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now we can also add a time delta object to a date time object,

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
let me show you. So for our first date time,

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm going to add the time delta of warn date. Now if

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we print this 1, we get,

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
january the second. And the difference is

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
323 days, however, someone who is looking at this code may

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
not be quite sure what this 1 here represents. Is it

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
1 day 1 hour, 1 second? So it's better to use keyword arguments

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
here, for clarity. Let's set days to 1.

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We can also set seconds to 1000.

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, let's run the program, so

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that gives us 16 minutes after January the 2nd.
