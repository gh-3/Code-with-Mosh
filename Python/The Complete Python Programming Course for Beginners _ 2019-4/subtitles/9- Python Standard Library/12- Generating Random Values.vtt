00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture you're going to learn how to generate random values in python,

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so on the top we import a random module. This module

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
has a method called random that generates a random value called

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
0 and 1. So let's print that.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And see the result. So we get a floating point number. Everytime

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we run this program, we get a different value. Now,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you also have another method rand int

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that generates a random integer between 2 numbers, lets say 1,

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and 10. So, we get 10,

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and now we get 2, 8, and so on. We have another

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
super useful method called choice, that takes an array

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
let's say an array of numbers and randomly picks one of the

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
numbers in this array. So let's run this program we get

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
3 now we get 2, 3, 4,

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and so on. Now we have a similar method, choices,

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that selects multiple values from this array. So

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
here as the second argument after this array, we need to supply keyword

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
argument that is k, we set it to 2,

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and this returns 2 random items,

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
from our original array. Now with this choice of method we can generate

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a random password. Let me show you. Now duplicate this line,

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
set k to 4, let's say you want a

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
password of 4 characters. Now instead of an array.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We should pass a string. So abcdefg

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
hi whatever basically we can pass any sequence to this

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
method, and it will take 4 items from that sequence.

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, when we run this program, we get

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
an array of 4 characters picked from this string here.

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Lets run the program one more time, now we get different characters,

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
there you go. So to generate the password we should

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
combine all these items in this array into a string,

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to do that, we create an empty string and call

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the joint method on it, and this will join all the items

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in an array using an empty string as a separator. So

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
when we run the program, we get a string instead of an array.

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now if we use a comma in the string, that comma will be used

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
as the separator when joining the items of this array. So let's

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
run the program one more time, see what we get? We didn't want it.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We want an empty string. And the only issue we have here

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
is the limited choice of characters. Now one way is to type all the

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
lower case and upper case as well as digits, but that is tedious, there is

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
a better way. You have this string module, let's import that,

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
this module has a few interesting

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
attributes, let's print string.

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
ascii letters. This returns a

46
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
string that includes all the lower and upper case letters.

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We also have ascii lower case, upper case, as well as

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
digits. Take a look, so we get all the numbers

49
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
from 0 to 9. Now instead of passing

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a string here, we can pass string

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
.ascii letters, plus string

52
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
.digits. So, let's run the program one more time,

53
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and here's our random password.

54
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Every time we run this program, we get a different password.

55
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We also have another useful method for shuffling an array. So let's say

56
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
we have an array of numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4,

57
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we can call random.shuffle and pass the

58
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
array here. Now when we get this,

59
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the order of these items are randomly changed. So let's

60
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
run the program, we get 4, 1, 3, 2. Let's run it again we get

61
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
2, 1, 3, 4. So this is how we can generate random values in python.
