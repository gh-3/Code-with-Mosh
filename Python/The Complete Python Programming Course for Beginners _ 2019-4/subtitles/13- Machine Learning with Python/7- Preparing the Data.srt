1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,680
The second step in a machine
 learning project is cleaning or preparing the

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,860
data and 
that involves tasks such as 
removing duplicates, null

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,000
values and so on. 
Now in this particular data set we don't have to do

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,300
any kind of cleaning because 
we don't have any duplicates and as

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,010
you can see all rows
have values for all columns. 
So

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,610
we don't have null values. 
But there is one thing we need to do. 
We

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,570
should split this data set into 
two separate data sets, one

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,310
with the first two columns which we
 refer to as the input set and

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,750
the other with the last column
 which we refer to as the output set.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,650
So when we train a model 
we give it to separate data sets: 

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,710
the input set and 
the output set. 
The output set which 

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,680
is in this case the genre column contains the predictions.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,150
So we're telling our model that
 if we have a user was 20

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,750
years old and is a male, 
they like hip hop. 
Once

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,090
we train our model, then 
we give it a new input set. 
For

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,450
example we say Hey we have
a new user who is 21 years

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,840
old and it's a male,
 What is the genre of the music that

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,410
this user probably likes? 
As you can see in our input set

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,900
we don't have a sample for a 21 year old male. 
So we're

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,160
going to ask our model to predict that. 
That is the

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,900
reason we need to split this
 data set into two separate sets:

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,660
input and output.
So back to our code

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,660
this data frame object has 
a method called drop. 
Now

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,060
if you put the cursor on
the method name and press shift and

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,200
tab you can see this tool tip.
So this is

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,500
the signature of this drop method.
These are the parameters that

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,270
we can pass here. 
The parameter we're going to use in this lecture is columns

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,390
which is set to None by default.
With this parameter

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,540
we can specify the columns
we want to drop. 
So in

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,610
this case reset columns to an array

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,430
with one string, genre. 
Now this method doesn't

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,630
actually modify the original data set.
In fact it will

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,750
create a new data set but without this column. 
So

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,650
by convention we use a
capital X to represent that

35
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,070
data set. 
So capital X equals this

36
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,660
expression. 
Now let's inspect X.

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,430
So as you can see our input set or X includes these

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,850
two columns: age and gender.
It doesn't have the output or

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,150
predictions. 
Next we need to create our output set. 
So

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,250
once again we start with
 our data frame music_data.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,800
Using square brackets we can
 get all the values in a

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,590
given column, in this case genre. 
Once

43
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,910
again this returns a new data set. 
By convention we

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,200
use a lowercase y to represent that. 
So that

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,860
is our output dataset.
Let's inspect that as well.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,350
So in this data set
we only have the predictions or

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,000
the answers. 
So we have prepared our data. 
Next we need to create a model using an algorithm.
