1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,550
A machine learning project involves a number of steps. 
The first step

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,100
is to import our data which 
often comes in the form of a csv

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,270
file. 
You might have a database with lots of data,
we can

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,660
simply export that data and 
store it in a csv file for

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,760
the purpose of our machine learning project.
So we import our

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,260
data, 
next we need to clean it and 
this involved tasks such

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,630
as removing duplicated data. 
If you have duplicates in the data, we

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,840
don't want to feed this to our model because 
otherwise our model will

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,630
learn bad patterns in the data and
it will produce the wrong result. 
So

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,270
we should make sure that our input
data is in good and clean shape. 
If

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,300
there are data that is irrelevant,
we should remove them. 
If they are duplicated or

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,430
incomplete, 
we can remove or modify them. 
If our

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,210
data is text based like 
the name of countries or genres

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,460
of music or cats and dogs,
we need to convert them to

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,570
numerical values. 
So this step really depends on the

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,410
kind of data we are working with.
Every project is different. 
Now

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,430
that we have a clean data set,
we need to split it into two segments: 
one

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,700
for training our model and
the other for testing it to

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,390
make sure that our model
produces the right result. 
For

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,600
example if you have 1000 pictures of cats and dogs, 
we can 

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,030
reserve 80% for training and 
the other 20% for

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,390
testing. 
The next step is to create a model and

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,350
this involves selecting an algorithm to analyze the data. 
There's

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,010
so many different machine learning algorithms out there
such as decision trees, 

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,490
neural networks and so on.
Each algorithm has pros and

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,720
cons in terms of
accuracy and performance. 
So the

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,220
algorithm you choose depends on 
the kind of problem you're trying to solve

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,260
and your input data. 
Now the good news is that we don't have to explicitly

29
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,900
program an algorithm. 
There are libraries out there that provide these

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,100
algorithms. 
One of the most popular ones which we're going to look at

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,370
in this tutorial is psychic learn.
So we build a

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,620
model using an algorithm,
next we need to train our

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,830
model. 
So we feed our training data. 
Our

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,000
model will then look for the patterns in the data. 
So next we

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,360
can ask it to make predictions. 
Back to example of cats

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,630
and dogs, we can ask our model is this a cat or

37
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,100
a dog. 
And our model will make a prediction. 
Now the prediction

38
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,350
is not always accurate.
In fact when you start out, it's

39
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,000
very likely that your predictions are inaccurate.
So we need to evaluate

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,380
the predictions and 
measure their accuracy. 
Then

41
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,220
we need to get back to our model and 
either select a different algorithm 

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,730
that is going to produce a more accurate resolve 
for the kind of problem we're

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,110
trying to solve or
 fine tune the parameters of

44
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,050
our model. 
So each algorithm has parameters that 
we can modify to

45
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,510
optimize the accuracy. 
So these are the high level steps

46
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,640
that you follow in a machine learning project.
Next we look at the libraries and tools for machine learning.
