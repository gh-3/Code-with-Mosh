00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,610
Any section you're going to learn about machine learning
 which is a subset of AI

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,950
or Artificial Intelligence, it's one
 of the trending topics in

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,450
the world these days and 
it's going to have a lot of applications in the future.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,310
Here's an example: 
Imagine I ask you to write a program to scan

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,860
an image until if it's a cat or a dog. 
If

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,490
you want to build this program using 
traditional programming techniques, your program

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,900
is going to get overly complex.
You will have to come up with lots

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,490
of rules to look for a specific curves, edges and colors

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,640
in an image to tell if it's a cat or a dog. 
But if I

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,340
give you a black and white photo,
your rules may not work, they may break. 
Then

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,440
you'll have to rewrite them. 
Or I may give you a picture of a cat or

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,520
a dog from a different angle
that you did not predict before. 
So solving

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,000
this problem using traditional programming
 technique is going to get overly

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,250
complex or sometimes impossible. 
Now to make the

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,140
matter worse, what if in the future
ask you to extend this program such

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,850
that it supports three kinds of animals: 
cats, dogs,

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,800
and horses. 
Once again you'll have to rewrite all those rules. 
That's

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,410
not going to work. 
So machine learning is a technique to solve these

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,120
kind of problems. 
And this is how it works: 
We build a model

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,490
or an engine and give it 
lots and lots of data. 
For 

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,940
example we give it thousands or 
tens of thousands of pictures of 

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,270
cats and dogs. 
Our model will then find and learn 

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,670
patterns in the input data,
so we can give it a new picture

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,060
of a cat that it hasn't seen before and 
ask it, is it a cat or

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,660
a dog or a horse? 
And it will tell us with a certain level of accuracy.

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,270
The more input data we give it,
the more accurate our model is

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,620
going to be. 
So that was a very basic example. 
But

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,010
machine Learning has other applications in 
self driving cars, robotics,

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,050
language processing, vision processing, 
forecasting things

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,360
like stock market, trends and
the weather, games and so on.

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,000
So that's the basic idea about machine learning. 
Next we'll look at machine learning in action.
