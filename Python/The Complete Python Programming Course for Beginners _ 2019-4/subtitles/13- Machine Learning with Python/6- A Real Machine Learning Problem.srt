00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,530
Over the next few lectures we're going to
work on a real machine learning project. 
Imagine

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,910
we have an online music store. 
When our users sign up we

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,680
asked her age and gender
and based on their profile we

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,270
recommend various music albums they are likely to buy. 
So

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,130
in this project we want to
use machine learning to increase sales. 
So

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,590
we want to build a model.
We feed this model with some sample

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,130
data based on the existing users.
Our model will

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,360
learn the patterns in our data so
we can ask it to make predictions. 
When

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,690
a new user signs up we tell our model
hey we have a new user with

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,360
this profile, 
what is the kind of music that this user is interested in?

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,340
Our model will say jazz or hip hop or whatever. 
and based

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,800
on that we can make suggestions to the user.
 So this is the problem

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,250
we're going to solve. 
Now back to the list of steps in a machine learning

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,660
project. 
First we need to import our data. 
Then we

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,430
should prepare or clean it.
Next we select a machine learning algorithm

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,590
to build a model.
We train our model. 
And ask it

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,310
to make predictions. 
And finally we evaluate our algorithm to

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,830
see its accuracy. 
If it's not accurate, we either fine tune

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,360
our model or 
select a different algorithm. 
So

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,370
let's focus on the first step.
Head over to bit.ly/

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,900
music-csv.
This is a very basic csv

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,250
that I've created for this project.
 It's just some random made up

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,630
data. 
It's not real.
So we have a table with

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,810
three columns: Age, gender and genre. 
Gender

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,380
can either be one
 which represents a male or zero

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,210
which represents a female.
Here I'm making a few assumptions. 
I'm

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,420
assuming that men between
 20 and 25 like hip

28
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,700
hop, men between 26 30 like

29
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,450
jazz and after the age
 of 30 they like classical

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,660
music. 
For women I'm assuming that

31
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,970
if they are between 20 and
25 they like dance music, 
If they're

32
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,530
between 26 30 they like acoustic music and

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,340
just like men after the age
of 30 they like classical music. 
Once

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,960
again this is a made up pattern.
It's not the representation of the reality.

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,660
So let's go ahead and
download this csv. 
click on

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,070
this dot dot dot icon here and 
download this

37
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,520
file. 
In my downloads folder here we

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,890
have this music that csv.
I'm going to drag and drop

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,820
this onto desktop because
that's where I've stored this

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,550
HelloWorld notebook. 
So I want you to put the csv file right next

41
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,670
your jupyter notebook. 
Now back to our

42
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,820
notebook. 
We need to read this csv file. 
So just like

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,420
before first we need to import 
the pandas module, so

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,360
import pandas as pd. 
And

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,680
then we'll call pd dot read underline csv

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,130
and the name of the file is music dot

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,640
csv. 
As you saw earlier this returns a data frame

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,560
which is a two dimensional array 
similar to an Excel spreadsheet. 
So

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,260
let's call that music_data.

50
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,390
Now let's inspect this music_data to make sure

51
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,510
we loaded everything properly. 
So run. 
So

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:17,000
here's our data frame. Beautiful. 
Next we need to prepare or clean the data. 
And that's the topic for the next lecture.
