00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,880
All right, once again,
it's time for another quiz,

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,080
let's see if you have been really
paying attention to this tutorial.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,640
So here's the first question.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,120
What are the built
primitive types in Python?

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,880
We have strength numbers and booleans

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,320
numbers can be integers,
float's or complex numbers.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,040
Here's the second question.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,880
You have this variable fruit set to apple.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,720
What do you think we will see on the
terminal when we print fruit of one?

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,400
Well, he was in square brackets,

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,240
we can access individual characters,
the index of the first character is zero.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,560
So this expression returns the second
character, which is Pete,

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,120
what if you had a colon,
a negative one here?

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,840
Well, using the syntax,

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,880
we can slice a string are start,
index is one and our end index is negative

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,120
one, which refers to the first
character from the end of the string.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
Now, when slicing a string,

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,720
the character at the end index
or negative one is not included.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,480
So with this expression will get all
the characters starting from the second

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,480
character, which is pee all
the way until we get to eat.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,640
So the result of this
expression is keep out.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,000
Here's another question.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,520
What is the result of this expression?

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,760
Well, this is what we call the modulus

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,960
operator, and it returns the remainder
of a division, which is in this case one.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,000
And finally, the last question,

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,240
what do you think we will see
when we print Bull of Boss?

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,920
Well, earlier, I told you about falsey
values in Python, so number zero,

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,320
an empty string and the non-allergic,
these are all falsey values.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Anything that is not falsey
is considered Truthy.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,080
Here we have a string
that has five characters.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
It doesn't matter what
those characters are.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,680
This is not an empty string.

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,440
So it's not falsey, it's Truthy.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,440
So when we converted, using the bool
function will get the boolean.

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,200
True.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,600
And this brings us
to the end of the section.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
In the next section, you're going to learn
the fundamentals of computer programing.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
I hope you have enjoyed this section.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,520
And thank you for watching.
