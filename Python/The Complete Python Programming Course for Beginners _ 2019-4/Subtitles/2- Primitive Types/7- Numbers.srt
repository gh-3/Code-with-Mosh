1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,380
mhm. Yeah. In

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,490
Python. we have three types of numbers.
 Two of these you

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,850
have already seen before.
 They are integers and floats

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,740
. We also have complex numbers. so

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,230
complex numbers in math are
 in the form A plus

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,760
B I where I is the imaginary number

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,540
. If you're not familiar with this concept.
 don't worry. This is something that

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,650
is used a lot in
 mathematics and electrical engineering. If

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,810
you want to use python to
 build Web applications. you're never going

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,480
to use complex numbers. But let
 me quickly show you the scene tax

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,750
for representing complex numbers instead of

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,930
I we use J.
 So here is an example one

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,060
plus two j. So X now is a complex number

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,010
. And by the way. as I told you before.
 this is just a comment or

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,760
an additional note in our program.
 When we run this program

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,380
. anything after this high
 sign will be ignored. So

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,820
these are the three types of
 numbers we have in python. For all

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,540
these types of numbers.
 we have the standard charismatic

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,770
operations that we have in mass.
 Let me show

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,050
you. So we have addition. subtraction

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,080
. multiplication division. But we

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,260
actually have two different types of divisions.
 Let me show you. First

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,300
. let's run this program.
 So with this division operator. which

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,510
is a slash. we get
 a floating point number. If

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,140
you want an integer.
 you use double slashes. Let

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,000
me show you. So double slash run

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,650
the program. We get three. Okay

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,490
. We also have module is which is

29
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,470
the remainder of a division. And finally. exponents

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,850
. which is left to
 the power of right. so

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,460
10 to the power of
 three will be 1000. These

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,800
are the standard arithmetic operators. Now. for

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,280
all these operators. we have
 a special operator called Augmented

34
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,780
Assignment. Operator. let me show you. So let's

35
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,260
imagine we have X set to 10

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,740
. We want to increment x by.
 Let's say three. We

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,410
can write an expression like this.
 X equals X plus

38
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,700
three. Or we can
 use an augmented assignment operator

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,610
that is a little bit shorter.
 So we write X plus

40
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,010
equal three. These two statements are

41
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,690
exactly the same.
 Now. here I am using addition

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,250
. As an example. you can
 use any of these operators here
