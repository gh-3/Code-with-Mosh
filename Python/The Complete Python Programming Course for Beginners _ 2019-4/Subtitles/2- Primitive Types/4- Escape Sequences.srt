1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,550
Mhm. Yeah. So

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,990
we have this string here.
 Python programming. Now let's say

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,200
we want to put a double
 coat in the middle of the

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,600
string. There is a problem here. Python interpreter

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,780
sees this second string
 as the end of the

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,860
string. So the rest of
 the code is meaningless and invalid

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,350
. How do you solve this problem.
 Well. there are two ways. One

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,680
way is to use single quotes for

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,160
our strength. And then we
 can use a double coat in

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,650
the middle of the strength.
 But what if. for whatever reason

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,250
. perhaps. for being consistent
 in our code. we decided

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,150
to yours Double cuts.
 How can we add another

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,700
double coat in the middle
 of the string. Well. we

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,880
can prefix this with a backslash. Backslash

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,270
in python strings is
 a special character. We have

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,840
a jargon for that called escape character. We

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,880
use it to escape the character after. Let

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,470
me show you what I mean.
 So let's print this

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,490
course I run this program. What's

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,740
going on here. We don't
 have the bag slash because we

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,990
use that to escape this
 double coat and basically displayed

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,230
here. So backslash is an

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,420
escape character and backslash double coat is

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,830
an escape sequence in python strength.
 We have a

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,450
few other escape sequences that
 you should be aware of. Let

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,220
me show you. So in Python.
 we use high sign

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,280
to indicate a comment.
 A comment is like additional note

28
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,260
that we add to our program.
 It's not executed by Python interpreter

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,810
. Okay. so here
 are the escape sequences You

30
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,590
have seen backslash double code. We also have

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,800
a backslash single code so we

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,480
can use that to add
 a single code. Here. Let's

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,950
run the program here it is beautiful. We

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,070
also have double backslash.
 So if you want to

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,310
include a backslash in your strings. you

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,650
should prefix it with another backslash.
 Let me show you

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,060
. So when we run this.
 we get Python one backslash programming

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,550
and finally we have backslash in which is

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,840
short for a new line.
 So now if I add a

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,960
backslash in here. see what we

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,720
get. We get a new line after

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,120
python. so programming will end
 up on the second line. So
