1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,720
So these are the variables
from the last lecture.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,040
I've got a question for you.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,120
There are four things that I've
consistently used in this program.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,280
Can you spot them?
If you want?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,320
You can positively think about this for a
few seconds and then continue watching.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
So here are those four things,

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,200
the first thing is that all my variable
names are descriptive and meaningful.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,360
So Students Count represents the number
of students for a course or course.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,920
Name clearly explains that this
variable holds the name of a course.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,400
One of the issues that I see a lot among

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,240
beginner programmers is that they use
mystical names for their variables,

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,680
something like this season
as a short four course name.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,400
When someone else reads this code,

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,720
they have no idea what's the N stands for,
or they use variable names like C one.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,040
When I look at that code,

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,560
I wonder where you see two and what
is the difference between C1 and C2.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,240
So these variable names are very mystical.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,080
That's a bad practice.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,160
Make sure your variable names are always

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,080
descriptive and meaningful because this
makes your code more maintainable.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,400
Now there are times that you can use short

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,800
variable names like X, Y, Z if you're
dealing with things like coordinates.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,640
So that's an exception.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,920
Now,
the second thing that I have consistently

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,000
used in this code is that I have used
lowercase letters to name my variables.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,480
So here we don't have course name all

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,240
in capital or in title case,
all letters are lowercase.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,920
Right.
Let's delete this.

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,040
The third thing that I've consistently

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,880
used here is that I have used
an underscore to separate multiple words,

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,000
and I've done this to make my variable
names more readable because in Python we

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
cannot have a space in variable names,
so we cannot have course name.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,400
And if you put these two words together,
it's a little bit hard to read.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,760
That's why we use an underscore.

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,360
And the fourth thing that I have used

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,040
consistently here is that I have put
a space around this equals sign.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,760
Again, that's one of the issues
I see a lot among beginners.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,600
They write code like this.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,560
This is a little bit ugly.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,200
This is what we call dirty code,
dirty, stinky, smelly.

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
You should write code that is clean

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,600
and beautiful so other people can read it
like a story, like a newspaper article.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,680
You should be formatted properly.

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,920
And that's why we have peppered in Python.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Now, the good thing is,

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,920
if you forget these rules,
when you save the changes,

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
all the pep aid kicks in and it
automatically reformats your code.

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,000
But that aside, you should always give

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,280
yourself the habit of writing clean code
without relying too much on the tooling.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,040
So these are all the best practices
about naming your variables.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,760
Next, we're going to look
at string's in more detail.
