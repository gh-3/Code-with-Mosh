00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alright, now we are ready to download and install python.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first thing I want you to do is open up your browser and

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
head over to Python.org. On this page,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
under the downloads, you can see the latest version of Python currently

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the latest version is 3.7. Chances are in the future

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when you're watching this video there's a newer version available, don't worry all the

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
materials in this course will continue to apply to future version

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of Python. So go ahead and download Python.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And then run it. If you're on Windows

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you're going to see this check box here, add Python path

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this is very important, make sure to take it otherwise you're not going to be able to

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
follow the course. So now go ahead and install it.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now let's verify that we have

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
installed Python properly. If you're on Windows

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
here in this search bar type cmd which is short for

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
command prompt. Now here in command prompt

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
type python, you can see we have successfully installed

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
python version 3.7. Now to

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
exit, press control z, and then enter.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Done. If you're on Mac

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
press command and space, this opens up the spotlight search

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so here type terminal.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Terminal on Mac is like command prompt on Windows. Now

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Mac and Linux by default come with an older version of Python, that is version 2,

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so if you type Python you can see Python 2 here. That's not

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
what we want. So press control D to exit and then run

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
python 3. And this verfiies that we have

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
successfully installed Python 3.7.
