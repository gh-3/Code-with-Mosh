00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So you have learned that in order to run this python program

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we'll have to open up a terminal window and run python on

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Windows or python3 on Mac and then app.py

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is a little bit tedious. so let me show you a shortcut.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Once again, let's go to the extensions panel, here search for

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
code runner.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are multiple code runners out there, the one that I'm talking about is

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
this one, with the yellow icon. So go ahead and

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
install this, and then reload vs code.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now instead of opening up the terminal and

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
manually typing python app.py all we have to do is

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to press control alt and n.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You can see the output here, beautiful. Just be aware that if

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you make any changes you will have to save the changes before using

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the shortcut, otherwise you're going to see the old result. Now there is a tiny

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
problem here, so you can see this is the command that is

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
executed to run this python program, so by default this

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
command is using python-u and here is the name of our file,

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
if you're on windows that's perfectly fine, but if you're on Mac,

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you know that Python refers to Python 2, here we

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
want to change this to Python 3. This is very easy.

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Once again, on the top under the code menu let's go to preferences.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then here,

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
under this ... go to open settings.

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
json. Now here in the search bar,

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
type code-runner.exe

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
cuter .map. So these are the default settings

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
used by this code runner extension, you can see this extension

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
supports executing code in a lot of languages like JavaScript, Java

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and so on. Now if you scroll down here you can see

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
python, and in front of that you can see the command that is used to

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
execute python code. We need to change this, however we cannot change

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the default settings, we should change the user settings so

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
on the right side under the setting, type a comma,

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and then in quotes type code-runnner.

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
executerMap and then press enter.

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This will automatically copy all the settings on the left side to the right side.

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now we can easily change one of these.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, here's python, let's change the command

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to python3. You only have to do this

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
if you're on Mac, and by the way, sorry if I have mentioned Windows and

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Mac a few times throughout this course, that's pretty much it, we are not going to differentiate

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
between Windows and Mac in the future, so save the changes and

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.233
we're done.
