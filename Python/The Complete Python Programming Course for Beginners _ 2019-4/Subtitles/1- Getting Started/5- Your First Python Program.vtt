00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now with VSCode open on the top,

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from the file menu go to open, and

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
somewhere on your desk, create a new folder. Let's call this

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
folder HelloWorld. And then

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
open it, beautiful, now click this icon on the top,

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this opens up the explorer panel. In this panel,

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you can see all the files and folders in your project. So let's

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
add a new file, and call that app.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
py. So all our python files should have the py

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
extension. Press enter. Now let's close

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
this. And type a bit of python code. In this lecture,

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we're going to use one of the built in functions in Python called

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
print. So in Python, we have a lot of built in functions for

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
performing various kinds of tasks. For example, as a midd of forth, think of the

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
remote control of your tv. on this remote control you have a bunch of

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
functions like turn on, turn off, change the chanel, change the volume

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and so on. These are the built in functions in your TV.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We have the same concept in python and many other programming languages.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So one of these built in functions that comes with python is print.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And we can use this to print something

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
on the screen. Now whenever you wanna use a function, you should open

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and close parenthesis. In programming we say

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
recalling the print function. Calling a function means executing it.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now let's display the hello world message

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
on the screen. Whenever you want to work with text, you should put your text

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in between quotes. Either double quotes

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or single quotes. Now I'm going to go with double quotes

28
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and add Hello World and

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
then put a happy Persian cat here, beautiful, save the changes

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
with command and s on Mac, or control and

31
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
S on Windows. Now to execute this code, we need to go back to

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
command prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac. But

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the good news is that we don't have to switch programs, here in VSCode

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
we have an integrated terminal, so press control

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and back tick, that is the key before number 1 on your

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
keyboard. It's just below the escape button.

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So this is our integrated terminal, now if you're on Windows

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
type python, but if you're on Mac or Linux, type Python 3,

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and next to that, add the name of our file, that is

40
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
app.py. And here's our Hello World message

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in the terminal, beautiful. Now let's take this to the next level

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and make it a little bit more interesting. Let's close this terminal Window

43
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
by pressing control and back tick and add a

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
second line of code, so one more time, print,

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
this time let's add quotes with a star in between them.

46
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now, let's see if you want to repeat this star ten times.

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So here we can multiply this by 10, save,

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the changes. Open up the terminal and run our program.

49
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And you can see this star is repeated

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
ten times. So as you can see the instructions in our program

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
are executed from top to bottom in order. In the

52
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
next lecture, I'm going to show you how to convert this vs code to a powerful

53
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
ID for building python applications.
